  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>‘<em>Mrs. Hungerford has well deserved the title of being one of the most
fascinating novelists of the day. The stories written by her are the airiest,
lightest, and brightest imaginable, full of wit, spirit, and gaiety; but they contain,
nevertheless, touches of the most exquisite pathos. There is something
good in all of them.</em>’—<span class='sc'>Academy.</span></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MAIDEN ALL FORLORN</strong>, and other Stories. Post
8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no guile in the novels of the authoress of “Molly Bawn,” nor any
consistency or analysis of character; but they exhibit a faculty truly remarkable
for reproducing the rapid small-talk, the shallow but harmless “chaff” of certain
strata of modern fashionable society.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>IN DURANCE VILE</strong>, and other Stories. Post 8vo.,
illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford’s Irish girls have always been pleasant to meet upon the
dusty pathways of fiction. They are flippant, no doubt, and often sentimental,
and they certainly flirt, and their stories are told often in rather ornamental
phrase and with a profusion of the first person singular. But they are charming
all the same.’—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MENTAL STRUGGLE.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards,
2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She can invent an interesting story, she can tell it well, and she trusts to
honest, natural, human emotions and interests of life for her materials.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MODERN CIRCE.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.;
cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford is a distinctly amusing author.... In all her books there
is a “healthy absenteeism” of ethical purpose, and we have derived more genuine
pleasure from them than probably the most earnest student has ever obtained
from a chapter of “Robert Elsmere.”’—<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>MARVEL.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The author has long since created an imaginary world, peopled with more or
less natural figures; but her many admirers acknowledge the easy grace and inexhaustible
<i><span lang="fr">verve</span></i> that characterize her scenes of Hibernian life, and never tire of
the type of national heroine she has made her own.’—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>LADY VERNER’S FLIGHT.</strong> Crown 8vo., cloth extra,
3s. 6d.; post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There are in “Lady Verner’s Flight” several of the bright young people who
are wont to make Mrs. Hungerford’s books such very pleasant reading.... In
all the novels by the author of “Molly Bawn” there is a breezy freshness of treatment
which makes them most agreeable.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>THE RED-HOUSE MYSTERY.</strong> Crown 8vo., cloth
extra, 3s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford is never seen to the best advantage when not dealing with
the brighter sides of life, or seeming to enjoy as much as her readers the ready
sallies and laughing jests of her youthful personages. In her present novel, however,
the heroine, if not all smiles and mirth, is quite as taking as her many predecessors,
while the spirit of uncontrolled mischief is typified in the American
heiress.’—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>THE THREE GRACES.</strong> 2 vols., crown 8vo., 10s. net.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is impossible to deny that Mrs. Hungerford is capable of writing a charming
love-story, and that she proves her capacity to do so in “The Three Graces.”’—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>The day is still lingering, but one can see
that night is beginning to coquet with it.
Tender shadows lie here and there in the
corners of the curving road, and in and among
the beech-trees that overhang it birds are
already rustling with a view to slumber.
The soft coo-coo of the pigeon stirs the air,
and on the river down below, ‘Now winding
bright and full with naked banks,’ the first
faint glimmer of a new moon is falling—falling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>as though sinking through it to a
world beneath.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What are you thinking of, Susan?’ asks
Crosby at last, when the sound of their feet
upon the road has been left unbroken for
quite five minutes. Susan has chatted to
him quite gaily all down the avenue, and
until the gates are left behind, but after that
she has grown—well, thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thinking?’ She looks up at him as if
startled out of a reverie.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes. What have you been thinking of
so steadily for the past five minutes?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus brought to book, Susan gives him the
truest answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I was thinking of Lady Muriel Kennedy.
I was thinking that I had never seen anyone
so beautiful before.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s high praise.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think so too?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well—hardly. She is handsome, very
handsome, but not altogether the most beautiful
person I have ever seen.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To me she is,’ says Susan simply.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>‘That only shows to what poor use you
have put your looking-glass,’ says he, and
Susan laughs involuntarily as at a most excellent
joke. Crosby, glancing at her and
noting her sweet unconsciousness, feels a
strong longing to take her hand and draw it
within his arm and hold it, but from such
idyllic pleasures he refrains.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dusky shades are growing more pronounced
now: ‘Eve saddens into night.’
The long and pretty road, bordered by overhanging
trees, though still full of light just
here, looks black in the distance, and overhead</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The pale moon sheds a softer day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mellowing the woods beneath its pensive beam.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>After a little silence Susan turns her head
and looks frankly at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you going to be married to her?’ asks
she, gently and quite naturally.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What!’ says Crosby. He is honestly
amazed, and conscious of some other feeling,
too, that brings a pucker to his forehead.
‘Good heavens, no! what put that into your
head?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>‘I don’t know. I——’ She has grown all
at once confused, and a pink flush is warming
her cheek. ‘Of course I shouldn’t have
asked you that. But she is so lovely, and I
thought—I fancied——I am afraid’—her
eyes growing rather misty as they meet his in
mute appeal—‘you think me very rude.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I never think you anything but just what
you are,’ says Crosby slowly. ‘I wonder if
you could be rude if you tried. I doubt it.
However, don’t try. It would spoil you. As
for Lady Muriel, she wouldn’t look at me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan remains silent, pondering over this.
Would he look at her?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Should you like her to?’ asks she at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To look at me?’ Crosby is now openly
amused. ‘A cat may look at a king, you
know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, but she——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is not the cat? That’s rude, any way.
Susan, I take back all the handsome things I
said of you just now. So I’m the cat, and
she is the queen, I suppose. Well, no; I
don’t want Queen Muriel to look at me. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>would be rather embarrassing, considering all
things. She is a very high and mighty young
lady, you know, and I’m terribly shy. On
the whole, Susan’—he pauses, and studies
her a minute—‘I should prefer you to look
at me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>His studying goes for naught; not a vestige
of blush appears on Susan’s face or any emotion
whatever. His little flattery has gone
by her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you know what I mean,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do I? You are often very deep, you
know; but if you mean that perhaps I should
like to marry Lady Muriel—well, I shouldn’t.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How strange!’ says Susan. ‘I think if I
were a man I should be dreadfully in love
with her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby laughs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So you think you could be dreadfully in
love?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s lips part in a little smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not as it is. I was only thinking of
Lady Muriel&#160;... and you—that you ought
to be——’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>‘Dreadfully in love? How do you know
I am not—with somebody else?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She shakes her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, you are not,’ says she. ‘After all, I
think you are just as little likely to be dreadfully
in love with anyone as I am.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan! You are growing positively profound,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>They are now drawing near to the Rectory
gates, and Susan’s fingers are stealing into
her pocket and out again with nervous
rapidity. Oh, she must give it to him now
or never! To-morrow it will be too late. One
can’t give a birthday gift the day after the
birthday. But it is such a ridiculous little
bag, and she has seen so many of his presents
up at the Hall, and all so lovely, and in such
good taste. Still, to let him think, after all
his kindness, that she had not even remembered
his birthday——</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby,’ says she, and now the hand
that comes from the pocket has something in
it. ‘I—all day, I’—tremulously—‘have
been wanting to give you something for your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>birthday. I know’—she pauses, and slowly
and reluctantly, and in a very agony of shyness,
now holds out to him the little silken
bag filled with fragrant lavender—‘I know’—tears
filling her eyes—‘after what I saw
to-day&#160;... those other gifts, that it is not
worth giving, but—I made it for you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She holds it out to him, and Crosby, who
has coloured a dark red, takes it from her,
but never a word comes from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dear, darling child! To think of her
having done this for him!... To Susan his
silence sounds fatal.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course,’ says she, ‘I knew you wouldn’t
care for it. But——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Care for it! Oh, Susan! To call yourself
my friend and so misjudge me! I care
for it a good deal more, I can tell you, than
for all those other things up there put together.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no mistaking the genuine ring in
his tone. Indeed, his delight and secret
emotion amaze even himself. Susan’s spirits
revive.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>‘Oh no,’ protests she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, though! No one else,’ says Crosby,
‘took the trouble to make me anything!
That’s the difference, you see. To make it
for me—with your own hands. It is easy to
buy a thing—there is no trouble there.’ He
looks at her present, turning and twisting it
with unmistakable gratification. ‘What a
lovely little bag, and filled with lavender,
eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is to put in your drawer with your
handkerchiefs,’ says Susan, shyly still; but
she is smiling now, and looking frankly delighted.
‘Betty made me one last year, and
I keep it with mine.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So we have a bag each,’ says Crosby, and
somehow he feels a ridiculous pleasure in the
knowledge that he and she have bags alike,
and that both their handkerchiefs will be
made sweet with the same perfume. And
now his eyes fall on the worked words that
lie criss-cross in one of the corners: ‘Mr.
Crosby, from Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean to say you actually did that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>too?’ asks he, with such extreme astonishment
that Susan grows actually elated.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes,’ says she, taking a modest tone,
though her conceit is rising; ‘it is quite easy.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To me it seems impossible. To do that,
and only with one’s fingers; it beats typewriting,’
says he. ‘It is twice as legible.
Do you mean to say you wrote—worked, I
mean—that with a common needle and
thread?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I did indeed,’ says Susan earnestly, her
heart again knowing a throb of exultation.
Why, if he could only see the cushion she
worked for Lady Millbank’s bazaar!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It must have taken a long time,’ says he
thoughtfully. And then, ‘And to think of
you doing it for me!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, for you,’ says Susan—‘you who have
been so kind to us all! I’—growing shy
again—‘I am very glad you really like that
little bag; but it is nothing—nothing. And
I was delighted to make it for you, and to
think of you all the time as I made it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Were you, Susan?’ says Crosby, as gratefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>as possible, though he feels his heart in
some silly way is sinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I was—I was indeed!’ says Susan openly,
emphatically. ‘So you must not trouble
yourself about that.’ Crosby’s heart falls
another fathom or two.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll try not to,’ says he, with a somewhat
melancholy reflection of his usual lightheartedness.
They have arrived at the gate
now, and Susan holds out her hand to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Remember you have promised to bring
up the boys to-morrow for their gipsy tea,’
says he, holding it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ She hesitates and flushes warmly.
‘Might I bring Betty, too?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, of course’—eagerly. ‘Give my love
to her, and tell her from—my sister that we
can’t have a gipsy tea without her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And Lady Forster?’ Susan grows uncertain
about the propriety of asking Betty
without Lady Forster’s consent.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, Susan! As if you aren’t clever
enough to know that Katherine delights in
nothing so much as young people—she’s quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>as young as the youngest herself—and that
she will be only too pleased to see a sister of
yours.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think that she likes me?’ Susan’s
tone is anxious.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think she has fallen in love with you.’
She smiles happily and moves a step away.
But his voice checks her: ‘Not the only one
either, Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not Captain Lennox again! I have
had one lecture.’ Susan looks really saucy,
for once in her life, and altogether delightful,
as she defies him from under her big straw
hat.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No. I was thinking of——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes?’—gaily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never mind.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He turns and walks away, and Susan,
laughing to herself at his inability to accuse
her further, runs down the little avenue to
her home. There is a rush from the lawn as
she comes in sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, there you are, Susan!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>‘How did it go off?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Were they all nice? Were you nervous?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is the house lovely?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it is!’ says Susan, now having reached
a seat, and feeling a little consequential with
all of them sitting round her and waiting on
her words. ‘You never saw such a house!
Much, much more beautiful than Lady Millbank’s.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, we all know it’s twice—four times
the size; but Lady Millbank’s furniture
was——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that’s all changed. Mr. Crosby
has furnished his house all over again from
beginning to end. Of course we’ve been
through it many times when he was away,
but now you wouldn’t know it. It appears
he has had things stored up after his travels—left
in their cases, indeed—that lately have
been brought to light. The drawing-room is
perfect, and—the pictures——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And the people?’ asks Betty impatiently;
she is distinctly material.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very, very nice too—that is, most of them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Miss Prior was there. She—well, I can’t
bring myself to like her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What did she do to you?’ asks Dom.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, nothing; nothing really, only——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s enough,’ says Carew. ‘You didn’t
hit it off with her, evidently.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan hesitates, and as usual is lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can’t bear her,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And that lovely girl who drove home
with Mr. Crosby?’ asks Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, she is even lovelier than I thought,’
says Susan, with increased enthusiasm. She
finds it quite easy to praise her now. ‘And
so charming! She wished particularly to be
introduced to me, and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did she?’—from Betty. ‘What a good
thing that she likes you! If she marries Mr.
Crosby she may be very useful to us.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think she is going to marry him,’
says Susan thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No?’—with growing interest. ‘They’—casting
back her thoughts—‘looked very like
it on Sunday. How do you know?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I asked him,’ says Susan simply.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>‘What!’ They all sit up in a body. ‘You—asked
him?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes. Does it sound dreadful?’ Poor
Susan grows very red. ‘It’—nervously—‘didn’t
sound a bit dreadful when I did it.
And’—desperately—‘I did, any way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It wasn’t a bit dreadful,’ says Carew
good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a bit. Go on, Susan.’ Dom regards
her with large encouragement. ‘Did you ask
him any more questions? Did you ask him if
he would like to marry you? There wouldn’t
be a bit of harm in that, either, and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dominick!’ says Susan in an outraged
tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Betty promptly catches his ear, and,
pulling him down beside her, begins to pommel
him within an inch of his life.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never mind him, Susan. He’s got no
brains. They were left out when he was born.
Tell us more about your luncheon-party.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is so little to tell,’ says Susan in a
subdued voice. Her pretty colour has died
away, and she is looking very pale.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>‘What about the poet?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, the poet! His name is Jones, of
all the names in the world!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here she revives a little, and at certain
recollections of the illustrious Jones, in spite
of herself, her smiles break forth again.
‘He——’ She bursts out laughing. ‘It
sounds horribly conceited, but I really think
he believes he is in love with me. Such nonsense,
isn’t it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>(Oh, too pretty Susan! who wouldn’t be
in love with you?)</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know about that,’ says Dom, who
has escaped from Betty’s wrathful hands and
is prepared to go any length to prevent a
recurrence of the late ceremonies. ‘He might
do worse!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And so the house is lovely,’ says Betty,
with a regretful sigh. Now if only they
would ask her there; but of course nobody
remembers second girls.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, lovely. The halls are all done up;
and there are paintings on the walls; and as
for the marbles, they are exquisite!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>‘Nice simple people, apparently,’ says
Dom. ‘Were they glass or stone, Susan?
Alleys or stony taws? Did you have a game
yourself? I’m afraid our education has been
a little neglected in that line; but, still, I
can recollect your doing a little flutter in the
way of marbles about half a decade or so ago;
and you won, too!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose you think you’re funny,’ says
Betty, which is about the most damping
speech that anyone can make, but Mr. Fitzgerald
is hard to damp. He gives her a reproachful
glance and sinks back with the air
of one thoroughly misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For the matter of games, I suppose they’—Betty
is alluding to Mr. Crosby’s guests—‘wouldn’t
play one to save their lives; quite
fashionable people, of course!’ Betty plainly
knows little of fashionable people. ‘Hardly
even tennis, I dare say. They would call
that, no doubt, fatiguing. Were they—were
they very starchy?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So far from that,’ says Susan, ‘that——’
She hesitates. ‘I’m almost sure I heard quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>right—and certainly Lady Forster asked
Mr. Crosby to let me stay on this evening,
and sleep there, so that I might take part
in——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She pauses.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Private theatricals?’ cries Betty excitedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No. I think it was a “pillow-scuffle”
they called it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a solemn silence after this, and
then, ‘A pillow-scuffle!’ says Betty faintly.
‘Are they so nice as that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They are. They are very nice, just like
ourselves.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This flagrant bit of self-appreciation goes
for a wonder unnoticed beneath the weight
of the late announcement.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why on earth don’t they ask us to go
up?’ says Dominick, who has many reasons
for knowing he could do much with a pillow.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, they have asked you,’ cries Susan
eagerly; ‘not for a pillow-match, but for
afternoon tea in the woods to-morrow. She—Lady
Forster, you know—was delighted
when she heard of you boys, and she said I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>was to be sure and bring you. And there is
to be a fire lit, and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Susan!’ cries Betty, in a deplorable
tone, tears fast rising to her eyes; ‘I think
you might have said you had a sister.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So I did—so I did’—eagerly; ‘and you
are to come too; and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no! Not really!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, really.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, darling Susan!’</p>

<p class='c010'>Friday has dawned, and is as delightful a
day as ever any miserable out-of-door entertainer
can desire; and Miss Barry, in spite
of her tremors, and her fears for the success
of this, her first big adventurous party, feels
a certain sense of elation. Yes, to-day she
is going to entertain all the party at the
Park; yesterday the Park had entertained
all her young people. The good soul (so
good in spite of her temper and her peculiarities)
has felt deep joy in the thought that
the children had been not only invited, but
actually sought after, by all those fashionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>folk up there, and though she would have
died rather than boast of it to her neighbours,
being too well-born for boasting of that kind,
still, her own heart swells with pride at the
thought that, in spite of their poverty, the
children’s birth has asserted itself, and carried
them through all difficulties to the society
where they should be.</p>

<p class='c004'>So happy has she been in her unselfish
gladness, that she has forgotten to scold one
of them for quite ten hours. And now Friday,
the day of her coming triumph, has arrived,
and she has risen almost with the sun that
has brought it. There is so much to be done,
you see: the best table-cloths to be brought
out, and the old Queen Anne teapot to get
a last rub, and all the cakes to be made!
There will be plenty of time for the baking
of them before five o’clock, at which hour
Lady Forster has arranged to come with all
her guests.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan and Betty have been busy with the
drawing-room—one of the smallest rooms on
record; a fact, however, made up for lavishly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>by the size of the furniture, which would not
disgrace a salon. It is now, to confess the
truth, in the sere and yellow stage, and some
of the chairs have legs that are distinctly
wobbly, and by no means to be depended
upon.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hurry up, Susan!’ says Betty. ‘The
room will do very well now, especially as no
one will come into it. They are sure to stay
in the garden this lovely evening. Come
and see about the flowers for the table.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, look at that screen!’ cries Susan; and
indeed, as a fact, it is upside down.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never mind! Come on,’ says Betty impatiently,
dragging her away. ‘Even if it
is the wrong way up it doesn’t matter. It
looks twice as Japanesey that way. I wonder
if the boys have brought the fruit yet?’</p>

<p class='c004'>When first Dominick had heard of Miss
Barry’s intention of giving a party for the
Park people, he had decided that at all risks
it should be a success. But his quarter’s
allowance was, as usual (he had received it
only a month ago), at death’s door, and only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>thirty shillings remained of it. He had at
once written to his guardian saying circumstances
over which he had no control—I suppose
he meant his inability to refrain from
buying everything his eye lit on—had made
away with the sum sent last June, and he
would feel immensely obliged to Sir Spencer
if he could let him have a few pounds more,
or even give him an advance on his next
allowance. The answer had come this morning,
had been opened hurriedly, but, alas! had
contained, instead of the modest cheque asked
for, a distinct and uncompromising ‘No.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mean old brute!’ said Dom indignantly,
referring, I regret to say, to his uncle. ‘I
wrote to him for a bare fiver, and the old
beast refuses to part. Never mind, Susan!
We’ll have our spread just the same. I’ve
thirty shillings to the good still, and that’ll
get us all we want.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, indeed, Dom,’ said Susan, flushing.
‘You mustn’t spend your last penny like that.
We’ll do very well as we are, with auntie’s
cakes.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>‘We must have fruit,’ said Mr. Fitzgerald
with determination. ‘Do you remember all
those grapes yesterday, and the late peaches
and things?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Indeed they had had a most heavenly
day yesterday—a distinctly rollicking day—in
the woods, and had played hide and
seek afterwards amongst the shrubberies,
at which noble game Lady Forster and Miss
Forbes had quite distinguished themselves,
the latter beating Dom all to nothing in the
dodging line, and reaching the goal every
time without being caught. It had been
altogether a splendid romp, and the Barrys
had come home flushed and happy, and with
so much to tell their aunt that their words
tumbled over each other, and were hard to
put together in any consecutive way. I
think Aunt Jemima was a little shocked
when Betty told her that Lady Forster had
called Carew ‘a rowdy-dowdy boy,’ but she
fortified herself with the thought that no
doubt the world had changed a good deal
since she was a girl—as no doubt it had.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Any way, the children were delighted, and
Dominick felt that nothing they could do for
the Park people, and especially for that jolly
Miss Forbes, could be good enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We must have some grapes,’ said he,
‘and even if it is to be my last penny, Susan,
I am sure I can depend on you to patch up
my old breeches so as to carry me with decency,
if not with elegance, through the next
two months.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, Dom—I really don’t think you
should——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never mind her,’ Betty had said promptly
here—Betty, who is devoid of any sort
of false shame, and looks upon Dom as a
possession; ‘of course we must have fruit.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And those little cakes at Ricketty’s, with
chocolate on them. Put on your hat, Betty,
and come down town with me, and we’ll
astonish the natives yet!’</p>

<p class='c004'>But Betty had too much to do, and finally
Carew had gone off with Dom on a foraging
quest, and now, as the girls come out of the
drawing-room, they meet the two boys ‘laden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>with golden grain,’ like the <em>Argosy</em>, and eager
to display their purchases.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such grapes! Such dear sweet little cakes!
They are all enchanted; and soon the table,
delicately laid out in a corner of the queer,
pretty old garden, is a sight to behold! And
beyond lies the tennis-court—one only, but
so beautifully mown and rolled, looking like
the priest of famous history, all ‘shaven and
shorn.’</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>‘Didn’t I tell you it was a perfect old
garden?’ Lady Forster is saying, addressing
Lady Muriel, who is laughing, quite immensely
for her, at one of Carew’s boyish
jokes. Lady Forster is dressed in one of her
smartest gowns—a mere trifle, perhaps, but
done to please, and therefore a charming
deed. And all her guests, incited by her, no
doubt, have donned their prettiest frocks, so
that Miss Barry’s garden at this moment presents
a picture more suggestive of a garden-party
at Twickenham than a quiet tea in the
grounds of an old Irish rectory.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>‘It is too pretty for anything,’ says Lady
Muriel. ‘I wouldn’t have missed it for a
good deal. I think it was very kind of your
aunt, Mr.——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Carew!’ says he quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘May I? What a charming name! It
was very kind of your aunt, Carew’—smiling—‘to
ask us here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is very kind of you to come,’ says
Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you run over to town?’ asks Lady
Muriel. It has occurred to her that she
would like to repay this pretty kindness of
Miss Barry’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no’—shaking his handsome head. And
then frankly, ‘We are too poor for that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! your sister ought to come,’ says she,
after which she grows thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby glances quickly at her. He has
heard that last remark of hers, and somehow
resents it. Susan—in London!</p>

<p class='c004'>He had taken his cup of tea from Miss
Barry a little while ago, and carried it to
where Susan is sitting, throwing himself on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the grass at her feet, his cup beside him.
Lady Muriel’s words grate on him. He looks
up now at the pure profile beside him, and
wonders what would be the result of starting
Susan as a debutante in town under good
auspices. What?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are thinking,’ says Susan softly,
breaking into his reverie gently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I was thinking.’ He looks up at
her. ‘If I said of you, would you believe
me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a bit’—gaily. ‘Anyone would say
that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Would they?’ His regard grows even
more pronounced. How many have said that
to her? How, indeed, could anyone refrain
from saying it? And—he draws his breath
a little quickly here, as conviction forces itself
on him—and everyone with truth! ‘Susan,
this is disgraceful!’ says he carelessly. ‘You
must have had a long list of flirtations to
speak like that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan laughs merrily. She is in high
spirits. All is going so well, and even Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Millbank has praised the tea-cakes—Lady
Millbank, who never praises anything! But
to-day Lady Millbank has changed her tune.
Perhaps no one had been so astonished as
she, to see all the Park people here to-day in
this quiet old garden. She had been asked
to meet them, of course, being a friend and
distant relation of the Rector’s; but she had
dreamed of seeing only Lady Forster, for half
an hour or so, as a concession to her brother’s
parish priest, and now—now—here they all
are! All these smart people, who had refused
to go to her only the day before yesterday!
Now, horrid snob that she is, she
goes quite out of her way to be nice to the
Barrys.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A disgraceful list, indeed!’ says Susan,
laughing down into Crosby’s eyes. Oh,
what pretty eyes hers are!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You acknowledge it, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly. It is a list so bare that one
must be ashamed of it. Not even one name!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What about James, the redoubtable?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, if you are going to be stupid!’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>she; and, rising with a pretty show of scorn,
she leaves him. It is not entirely her scorn
of him, however, that leads her to this drastic
step; it is an appealing glance from Betty,
who is sitting near her aunt, looking perplexed
in the extreme. There is cause for
perplexity. Next to Miss Barry sits the
poet! Unfortunately Miss Barry has heard
a great deal about this young man and all
his works, and plainly considers it her duty
to live up to him, if possible, during his visit
to the Rectory. She has now put on quite a
literary air and her best spectacles, and is
holding forth on literature generally, with
a view to impressing him. She succeeds
beyond her expectations. The great Jones,
who is reclining beside her in an artistic
attitude, becomes by degrees smitten into
stone, so great, so wondrously surprising,
are some of her utterances. Through all
his astonishment, however, he holds on to
the artistic pose. Having struck it with the
intention of conquering Susan, he refuses to
alter it until, at all events, she has had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>good look. It may be a long time, poor girl!
before she will get the chance of seeing anything
like it again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What’s the matter with his leg?’ asks
Dom, who has just come up, in a whisper to
Betty. ‘It’s got turned round, hasn’t it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It looks broken,’ says Betty. ‘But it’s
all right. It’s a way he has with it. For
goodness’ sake, Dom, stop auntie, if you can.’</p>

<p class='c004'>But auntie is enjoying herself tremendously,
and now, seeing her audience greatly increased,
and the poet evidently much struck,
her voice rises higher, and she beams on all
around her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My two favourite authors,’ she is now
saying, ‘are—and I’m sure you will agree
with me, dear Lady Forster, and you too,
Mr. Jones: your opinion’—with alarming
flattery—‘is indeed important—my two
favourite authors are dear Wilkie Trollope
and Anthony Collins!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Great sensation! Naturally everyone is
impressed by this startling declaration, and
Miss Forbes is actually overcome. At all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>events, she subsides behind her parasol, and
is for a little time lost in thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes. Charming people—charming!’
says Lady Forster quickly, if a little hysterically;
and the poet, having seen Susan’s
eye upon him and his pose, and feeling that
he has not endured the last half-hour in vain,
struggles into a more every-day attitude.
Pins and needles, however, having set in in
the most <i><span lang="fr">posé</span></i> of the legs, he is conscious of
a good deal of unpleasantness, and at last a
desire to get up. Essaying to rise, however,
it distinctly declines to support him, and, to
his everlasting chagrin, he falls ‘plop’ upon
the ground again, in a painfully inartistic
position this time.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Anything wrong, old man? Got a cramp?’
asks Captain Lennox, hauling him into sitting
posture.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is nothing, nothing,’ says the poet
sadly. Oh, what it is to dwell in the tents
of the Philistines! ‘I was merely overcome
by the beauty of this divine spot.’ He gives
a sickly glance at Susan. ‘Such tones, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>know! Such colour! Such a satisfying
atmosphere!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Susan, who is under the impression
that he is ill, brings him hurriedly a cup of
coffee, which he takes, pressing her hand,
and murmuring to her inaudible, but no
doubt very ‘precious,’ things.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘One yearns over the beautiful always,’
says he. It is plain to everyone that he is
yearning over Susan, and Crosby, looking on,
feels a sudden mad longing to kick him over
the laurel hedge on to the road below. ‘And
such a spot as this wakes all one’s dreams
into life. Those trees! Those distant
glimpses! The little soft throbs of Nature—Mother
Nature! All, all can be felt!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wish to heaven I could make him feel
something!’ says Sir William in a low but
moving tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And there—over there; see those green
glimpses, the parting of the leaves.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, go on, go on,’ says Miss Barry, growing
tearful behind her glasses. ‘This is indeed
beautiful!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>‘Dear lady, you feel it too! There’—pointing
to where the Cottage trees seem
to become one with those of the Rectory—at
which Wyndham starts slightly, ‘one
can see the delicate blendings of Nature’s
sweetest tints, and can fancy that from
between those pleasant leaves a face might
once again, as in the old, sweet phantasies,
peep forth. This dear place looks as if
Hamadryads had not yet died from out the
world: as if still they might be found inhabitating
these lovely ways. Almost it
seems to me as if their divine faces might
even now be seen, peeping through those
perfumed greeneries beyond.’</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>‘Spite is a little word, but it represents as strange
a jumble of feelings and compound of discords as any
polysyllable in the language.’</p>
<p class='c010'>Involuntarily, unconsciously, all their eyes
follow his, to the trees in the Cottage grounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A profound silence falls on the group.
Captain Lennox, whose eyeglass is immovably
fixed on something in the distance, is the
first to break it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Almost it does!’ says he, mimicking the
poet’s lachrymose drawl to a nicety. But no
one laughs; they are all too engrossed with
what they see, peeping out shyly from between
the branches of those trees below,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>that seem to belong to the Rectory, meeting
them as they do, and mingling with
them so closely that one loses memory of
the road that runs between. ‘I feel as if I
saw one now. How do you feel, Forster?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William laughs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A charming Hamadryad beyond dispute,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>Charming indeed! Crowned by the leaves
that hang above her head, Ella’s face is looking
out at them like some lovely vision.
Her face only can be seen, but that very
distinctly. To her, unfortunately, it had
seemed quite certain that she could not be
seen at all. It was so far away, and they
would be talking and thinking, and it was
so hard to resist the desire to see them.
Carew had insisted on her being asked to
join their party, and Susan had begged and
implored, but Ella had steadfastly refused to
accept the invitation. And then Susan had
remembered that strange minute or two
during her luncheon at the Park, and the
evident anxiety of Mr. Wyndham that Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Prior should know nothing about Ella, and
had refrained from further pressing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now again this uncertain certainty occurs
to Susan, and she makes a little eager gesture,
hoping that Ella will see her and take the
hint and go away. But, alas! Ella is not
looking at her, or at Carew, or anyone,
except—strange to say—at Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is an intensity in her gaze that even
at such a distance Susan, who is eminently
sympathetic, divines.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s her bonnet!’ thinks Susan hurriedly;
she had, indeed, been immensely struck by
Mrs. Prior’s head-gear on her arrival. Such
a tall aigrette, and such big wings at the
sides! Again she makes little passes in the
air, meant for Ella’s benefit, but again in
vain. Turning with a view to enlisting
Carew’s help, she finds herself close to
Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>His face is livid. He is, indeed, consumed
with anger. Good heavens, is the girl bent
on his undoing? Is she determined wilfully
to add to the already too <em>risqué</em> situation?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>‘Carew might do something,’ whispers she
to him softly. ‘He might run across and
tell her she can be seen, or——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She looks round for Carew, and Wyndham
follows her lead, to see Carew behind an
escallonia bush, waving his arms frantically
in the air. There is intense anxiety in the
boy’s air, but something else too. There is,
as Wyndham can see, heartfelt admiration;
and beyond all doubt the admiration outweighs
the anxiety. He is conscious of a
sensation of annoyance for a moment, then
his thoughts come back to the more pressing
need. He looks at Susan, and then expressively
at Mrs. Prior, and Susan, in
answer to his evident entreaty, goes quickly
to her, and suggests softly a little stroll
through the old orchard; but Mrs. Prior
peremptorily puts her aside, and, taking a
step forward, comes up to Wyndham, and
looks straight at him in a questioning fashion,
at which—as though by the removal of Mrs.
Prior’s eyes from hers Ella all at once ceases
to be under some strange spell—the charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>head between the sycamore-trees disappears
from view, and no more is seen of Mr. Jones’s
Hamadryad.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“Though lost to sight, to memory dear!”’
breathes Captain Lennox sentimentally. ‘I
feel I shall remember that goddess of the
grove as long as I live.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The tiny excitement is at an end for most
of the guests, and they are now chatting
gaily again of petty nothings, all except
Mrs. Prior, who is still looking at Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who is that girl?’ asks she, in a low but
firm tone. Wyndham would have spoken,
but Carew breaks angrily into the conversation.
His heart is sore, his boyish indignation
at its height. Surely there had been
disrespect in their tone as they spoke of
Ella! He had specially objected to that word
‘Hamadryad.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is a young lady who has taken
Mr. Wyndham’s cottage,’ says he, in his
clear young voice, ‘and a friend of my
sister’s.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, indeed!’ says Mrs. Prior. ‘I congratulate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>you, Paul’—turning a withering
glance on him—‘on your taste in tenants!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The evening lights are falling—falling
softly, tenderly, but surely. The crows are
sailing home to their beds in the elm-trees,
cawing as they come. The tall hollyhocks are
growing indistinct, the tenderer colours fading
into white. There is a rising odour of damp,
sweet earth upon the air. Lady Forster is
making little signs of departure—not hurried
signs, by any means; she seems, indeed,
rather reluctant to say good-bye, but Mrs.
Prior has said something to her, on which
she has risen, the others following her example.
There is no doubt about Mrs. Prior’s
anxiety to go. With her face set like a flint,
she is already bidding Miss Barry a stiff farewell,
and is waiting with ill-concealed impatience
for Lady Forster.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye, Susan,’ says Crosby, coming
up at this moment to the slim maiden who
bears that name. ‘Though you deserted me
so shamelessly a while ago, I bear you no
ill-will. I understood the action. It was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>guilty conscience drove you to it. I asked
you a simple question, and you refused to
answer it. I ask it again now.’ A pause,
during which Susan taps her foot on the
ground, and tries to assume a puzzled air
that would not have deceived a boy. ‘And
you still refuse, Susan?’—tragically. ‘Is it
that you can’t?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Can’t what?’—blushing fatally.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Can’t say that the redoubtable James is
nothing to you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose you want to drive me away
again,’ says Susan demurely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That subterfuge won’t answer a second
time. Don’t dream of it. If you attempt
to fly me now, I warn you that I shall
grapple with that blue tie round your neck,
and—you wouldn’t like a scene, Susan, would
you? Come, is he nothing to you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I really wonder,’ says Susan, struggling
with a desire for laughter that brightens up
her pretty eyes and curves the corners of her
lips, ‘that after all I have said before you
should still persist in this nonsense.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>‘That still is no answer. I don’t even
know if it is nonsense. I begin to suspect
you of being a diplomatist, Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not,’ says she, a little indignantly.
‘I am nothing in the world but what you
see—just Susan Barry.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And that means—shall I tell you what
that means?’ He is smiling lightly, easily,
but a good deal of heartfelt passion can lie
behind a smile. ‘Shall I?’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is another question. But Susan,
softly glancing, puts that question by.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What, no answer to anything?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not to silly things.’ She shakes her
head. ‘Besides, it’s my turn now. Do
you’—she lays her hand lightly on his arm
and looks cautiously round her—‘do you
think it—is all right?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘All right? How should I know? You refuse
to answer me, and what do I know of James?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, oh, oh!’ Her soft voice shows irritation,
and her hand trembles on his arm as
if she would dearly like to shake him. ‘I
begin to hate James.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>‘Ah, now we get near the answer,’ says he.
‘I feel better. Go on. What’s to be all
right?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You saw Ella—Mr. Wyndham’s tenant,
you know—in the tree over there a little
time ago. What do you think about it? I
thought Mrs. Prior looked put out. But
what can it matter to her who is living there?
Did she want the Cottage?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It seems a fair solution of the problem,’
says Crosby thoughtfully, and, after all, truthfully
enough. Certainly Mrs. Prior has
worked for eighteen months, not only for the
Cottage, but for the owner of the Cottage
and all the rest of his possessions for her
daughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But she won’t be disagreeable to poor
Ella, will she?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Won’t she, if she gets the chance!’ thinks
Crosby. ‘Must see that she doesn’t get it,
though. No, no; of course’—out aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And you think it doesn’t matter her being
seen; that nothing will come of it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Only a most infernal row,’ thinks Crosby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>again, but says: ‘Naturally nothing. Besides,
Mrs. Prior is going home to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I’m glad of that,’ says Susan. ‘I
didn’t like her expression when she saw Ella.
And now I must go; Lady Forster wants to
say good-bye to me.’ She turns, then runs
back again. ‘Oh, a moment. Tell me’—looking
at him eagerly, but shyly—‘you—do you
really think it has gone off—well?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The eyes are so anxious that Crosby feels
it is impossible to jest here. This little party
has seemed a great deal to her—quite a tremendous
event in her calm, isolated life.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I heard Katherine say just now,’ says he,
‘that she had never enjoyed herself so much
in all her life!’ And if he hadn’t heard
Katherine say that, I hope it will be forgiven
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And—and the others?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“The proof of the pudding is in the eating,”’
quotes he solemnly. ‘In my opinion
you will have to get up the sergeant and all
his merry men to turn them out.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, now!’ says Susan, with a lovely laugh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that has such sweet and open gratification in
it, ‘that’s too much. And you’—anxiously—‘you
weren’t dull?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He pauses; then: ‘I don’t think so.’ He
pauses again, as if to more religiously search
his memory. ‘I really don’t think so!’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Susan laughs with even greater
gaiety than before, and he laughs too, and
with a little friendly hand-clasp they part.</p>

<p class='c004'>It doesn’t take the Barrys—that is, Susan,
Dom, Carew, and Betty—a second after their
guests have gone, to scamper down the road
to the little green gate and beat upon it the
tattoo that is the signal between them and
Ella. And it takes only another moment for
Ella herself to open the gate cautiously,
whereupon she finds herself instantly with
her hands full of cakes and fruit and sweets
that they have brought her from their party,
leaving the rest to the children, who had
really behaved remarkably well all through
the afternoon, thanks to the sombre Jacky,
who had kept them under his unflinching
eye.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>‘Well, we’re alive,’ cries Betty. ‘Rather
the worse for wear, but still in the land of
the living. And, really, it went off miraculously
well—for us. Not even a fly in the
cream. You saw us, I know. How did we
look?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it was all so pretty—so pretty!’ says
Ella, a little sadly, perhaps, but with enthusiasm
that leaves nothing to be desired.
‘Yes, of course I saw you. I climbed up
the tree. But’—nervously, looking at Susan—‘I’m
afraid they saw me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly they saw you,’ says Carew, a
little hotly. ‘Why shouldn’t they?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no! I didn’t want that. I am sorry,’
says Ella, with evident distress. ‘I thought
I was quite safe there—that no one could see
me. But—Susan—did Mr. Wyndham see me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Susan gently. Ella’s distress
at once growing deeper, she goes on hurriedly:
‘But, as Carew says, why not? It
is your own place—your own tree—and I
have always said you ought to come out and
mix with us.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>‘No, no!’—hurriedly. All at once it seems
to her that she must tell Susan the whole
truth; how it is with her, and her horror of
being discovered by that man, and the past
sadness of her life, and the present loneliness
of it. But not now; another time, when
they are quite alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The poet saw you, at all events,’ says
Dom. ‘He’s not quite right in his head,
poor old chap! and he got very mixed. He
thought you were a Hindoo idol——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dominick!’ Betty turns upon him indignantly.
‘How disgracefully ignorant you
are! After all papa’s teaching! Hamadryads
aren’t Hindoo idols. They are lovely
things. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am—I am,’ says Mr. Fitzgerald, with
resignation. ‘I really don’t think I shall
pass any exam.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You don’t try,’ says Susan, with a slight
touch of anger. ‘You don’t put your mind
into your work. And it is such a shame
towards father. Why don’t you try?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>‘He does try!’ says Betty angrily. She
is so evidently on the defensive—on the side
of the prisoner at the bar—that they all stare,
a matter that brings her to her senses in a
hurry. She to defend Dom, with whom she
is always at daggers drawn! A gleam of
pleasure in Dom’s eyes enrages her, and
brings the crisis.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He does try,’ repeats she. ‘But’—with a
glance at Dom meant to reduce him to powder—‘he
has no brains.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The glance is lost. Dom comes up smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You’ve got it,’ says he. And then, ‘Anyway,
Miss Moore, our only poet thought you
were a sylvan goddess. Will that do, Betty?
Didn’t he, Carew?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s a fool,’ says Carew morosely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did you notice him, Ella?’ asks Betty.
‘A little man with a dismal eye and a nose
you could hang your hat on? If poets are
all like that, defend me from them! He
goes about as if he was searching for a corner
in which to weep, and he looks as if——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“’E don’t know where ’e are,”’ quotes Dom.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>‘Yes, I saw him. He was sitting near
you, Susan; and I saw Mr. Wyndham,
and——’ She pauses, and a faint colour
steals into her cheeks. ‘Susan, who was
that woman with the high things in her
bonnet?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘High things!’ Susan looks puzzled, and
Ella goes on to describe Mrs. Prior’s bonnet
with more extreme accuracy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That was Mrs. Prior—Mr. Wyndham’s
aunt. Fancy your noticing her! Do you
know, Ella, I can’t bear her, or her daughter.
They are all so—so unreal—so cruel, I
think——’</p>

<p class='c004'>But Ella is hardly listening. Her eyes are
troubled. She is thinking—thinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is strange,’ says she at last, ‘but, somehow,
it seems to me as if I had seen her
before. Not here—not now—but long, long,
long ago.’ She makes a little movement of
her hands as if driving something from her,
then looks at Susan. ‘It is nonsense, of
course.’ She is very pale, and her smile is
dull and lifeless. ‘But—I have seen her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>somewhere in my past—or someone like her;
but not so cold—so cruel.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is Mr. Wyndham’s aunt,’ says Susan
again. ‘Perhaps the likeness you see lies
there.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps so. But no, he is not like her,’
says the girl earnestly. ‘No, it is not Mr.
Wyndham she reminds me of.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My goodness, Susan,’ says Betty suddenly,
‘perhaps we should not have left all those
cakes with the children. They will make
themselves ill, and we shall have a horrid
time to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, and Bonnie!’ says Susan, paling. She
kisses Ella hurriedly and races home again
up the quiet little shadowy road, without
waiting for the slower coming of those behind
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Is this thing true, George?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What thing?’ asks Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you know—you know. You’—turning
her cold eyes on him with actual fury in
their depths—‘must have known it all along.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear Mrs. Prior, if you would only
explain!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Prior motions him to a seat. She is
already dressed for dinner, though it is barely
seven o’clock. She had, however, determined—after
a stormy interview with Josephine
on their return from the Rectory—on seeing
Wyndham at once, and demanding an explanation
with regard to ‘that creature,’ as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>she called her. Wyndham, it seemed, however,
had not yet returned. ‘Gone to see
her, no doubt,’ cried Mrs. Prior, with ever-rising
wrath; and thus foiled in her efforts
to see him, she had sent for her host, who, of
course, being a bosom friend of Wyndham’s,
and living down here, must have known all
about it from the first.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you think I need?’ says she, with a
touch of scorn. ‘Are you going to tell me
deliberately that you do not know what this—woman—is
to Paul?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘His tenant,’ says Crosby calmly. ‘What’s
the matter with that? Lots of fellows have
tenants.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is quite true. It is also true that
“lots of fellows”’—she draws in her breath
as if suffocating—‘have——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, come now!’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You would have me mince matters,’ says
she in her low, cold voice, that is now
vibrating with anger. ‘It is inadmissible, of
course, to mention things of this sort. But
I have my poor girl’s interest at stake, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>dare to go far—for her. This arrangement
of Paul’s down here, close to you’—she gives
him a sudden quick glance—‘in the very
midst of us, as it were, is a direct insult.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So it certainly would be, if matters were
as you suppose. I am confident, however,
that they are not. I have Paul’s word for it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, a man’s word on such an occasion as
this!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I suppose a man’s word, if you
know the man, is as good on one occasion as
another,’ says Crosby. ‘And why should he
lie to me about it? I have no interest in his
tenants. If, as you seem to fancy, she is——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, hush!’ says Mrs. Prior, making an
entreating gesture; ‘don’t speak so loud.
That poor child of mine—that poor, poor
child—is there’—pointing to the door on her
left—‘and if she heard this, it would almost
kill her, I think.’ Mrs. Prior throws a little
tragedy into her pale blue eyes. ‘Her heart
is deeply concerned—is filled, indeed, with
Paul! As you know, George, for years this
engagement has been thought of.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>‘Engagement?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Between’—a little impatiently, but
solemnly—‘Paul and——’ She stops as if
heart-broken, and covers her face with her
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Virginia,’ is on the tip of Crosby’s tongue,
but by a noble effort he swallows it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My unhappy Josephine,’ says Mrs. Prior,
having commanded her grief. ‘For myself,
I cannot see what the end of this thing will
be.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s an unlucky name beyond doubt,’ says
Crosby, growing historical. ‘I don’t think
I’d christen another—h’m—I mean, I don’t
think it is a good name to call a girl by, don’t
you know; but I fail to see where the unhappiness
comes in this time.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t you? Do you imagine my poor
child would wed a man with such disgraceful
antecedents? I had thought of the marriage
for next year; but now! And dear Shangarry
has so set his heart on a union between
my girl and Paul. Only last month he was
speaking to me about it. It will be a horrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>blow to the poor old man. Indeed, I
shouldn’t wonder if he disinherited Paul on
account of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here she looks steadily, meaningly at
Crosby. It is a challenge. Crosby quite
understands that he is to convey to Wyndham
that he is to give up his tenant, or else
Mrs. Prior will declare war upon him, and
prejudice the old man, his uncle, against him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On account of what?’ asks he, unmoved.
‘Because he has a tenant in his cottage, or
because——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, tenant!’ Mrs. Prior makes a swift
movement of her white and beautiful hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Or, because——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She interrupts him again, as he has expected.
He has no desire whatever to go
on; to say to her, ‘because he will probably
refuse to marry your daughter,’ would be a
little too broad. He has risked the beginning
of his speech with a hope of frightening her
into some sort of propriety; but he has failed.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There will be a scandal,’ says she, with
determination.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>‘Not unless somebody insists upon one.’
Crosby crosses one leg over the other with
a judicial air. ‘And scandals are so very
vulgar.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Quite the most vulgar things one knows;
but they do occur, for all that. And if Shangarry
once knew that Paul so much as
wavered in his allegiance to Josephine, he
would be very hard to manage.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But has it, then, gone so far as that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Far! What can be farther? A girl, a
young girl, and a—well, I dare say there are
some who would call her beautiful—kept in
seclusion, called, for decency’s sake, his
tenant——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that!’ says Crosby; ‘I wasn’t alluding
to that. I mean, has this affair between
your daughter and Wyndham gone so very
far? Is this engagement you hint at a thing
accomplished? Has it been settled?’ He
leans towards her in a strictly confidential
manner. ‘Any words said?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, words! What are words?’ says Mrs.
Prior. ‘Deeds count, not words. And all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>our world knows how attentive he has been
to my poor child for years.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a slip, and she is at once conscious
of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Years! Bad sign,’ says Crosby, stroking
his chin.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know what you mean by that’—irritably,
and with a view to retrieving her
position. ‘The longer the time, the greater
the injustice—the injury—afterwards. I feel
that my poor darling is quite compromised
over this affair. I need hardly tell you,
George, who know her, and how attractive
she is’—Crosby nods feelingly, and, I hope,
offers up a prayer for pardon—‘that she has
refused many and many a magnificent offer
because she believed herself pledged surely, if
unspokenly, to her cousin. Her great attachment
to him’—all at once Crosby sees
Josephine’s calm, calculating eyes and passionless
manner—‘has been, I now begin to
fear, the misfortune of her life, because certainly—yes,
certainly—he led her to believe
all along that he meant to make her his wife.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>‘Well, perhaps he does,’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What! And do you imagine I would
submit to—to—that establishment, whilst
my daughter——’ She buries her face in
her handkerchief. ‘Shangarry will be so
grieved,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a second threat, meant to be conveyed
to Wyndham. Crosby represses an
inclination to laugh. After all, she has
chosen, poor woman! about the worst man in
Europe for her ambassador. To him, Mrs.
Prior’s indignation is as clear as day. With
his clear common-sense he thus reads her:
She has doubts about Wyndham’s relations
with his pretty tenant, but she has deliberately
set herself to believe the worst. The
worst to her, however, would not be the
immoral attitude of the case, but the dread
that the girl would inveigle Wyndham into
a marriage with her, and so spoil her
daughter’s chance. The girl, as she saw her
through the spreading branches, was very
beautiful, and Josephine—well, there was
a time when she was younger, fresher.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>‘I really think, Mrs. Prior, you are making
a mountain out of a mole-hill,’ says he
presently. ‘I assure you I think this young
lady, now living in the Cottage, is nothing
more or less than Wyndham’s tenant. Why
make a fuss about it? I am sure if you ask
Wyndham——By-the-by, why don’t you
ask him?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Because he refuses me the opportunity,’
says Mrs. Prior. ‘I sent for him; he was
not to be found. He purposely avoids me
this evening. But he shall not do so to-morrow.
I am his aunt; I have every right
to speak to him on this disgraceful subject.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not disgraceful, I trust,’ says Crosby, who
is devoutly thanking his stars that Mrs. Prior
is not his aunt.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Utterly disgraceful, when I think of how
he has behaved to my poor trusting girl——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still,’ says Crosby thoughtfully, ‘you tell
me there were no words said.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No actual words.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, the others are so useless,’ says
Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Mrs. Prior lifts her eyes to his for a moment.
Real emotion shines in them; and all at once
Crosby is conscious of a sense of shame.
Poor soul! however mistaken, however contemptible
her trouble, still it is trouble, and
therefore worthy of consideration.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can see you are not on my side,’ says
she at last. ‘You have no sympathy with
my grief, and yet you might have. I have
had many griefs in my time, George, but this
is the worst of all. To have my daughter
thus treated! Of course, after this I could
not—I really believe I could not sanction her
marriage with Paul.’ She pauses, and
delicately dabs her handkerchief into her
eyes. Her hopes of a marriage between her
daughter and Wyndham have been at such
a low ebb for a long time that there is
scarcely any harm in declaring now her
determination not to wed her daughter to
her cousin at any price. If things should
take a turn for the better, if her threats
about informing Shangarry should take
effect, she can easily get out of her present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>attitude. ‘Yes, such troubles!’ She dabs
her eyes again. ‘First my sister’s terrible
marriage with a perfectly impossible person—you
know all about that, George—poor
dear Eleanor; and then my father’s will,
leaving everything to Eleanor and her
children, though he had so often excommunicated
her, as it were. And the trouble with
that will! The searching here and there for
Eleanor—poor Eleanor; such awful trouble—advertisements,
and private inquiry people,
and all the rest. As you know, it is only
quite lately that, certain information of her
death without issue having come to hand, I
have been enabled to live.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—yes, I know,’ says Crosby. He is
on his very best behaviour now.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have always appreciated my sweet
girl at her proper worth, at all events,’ says
Mrs. Prior, dabbing her eyes for the last
time, and emerging from behind her handkerchief
with wonderfully pale lids.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have—I have indeed!’ exclaims Crosby
warmly. Anything to pacify her! His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>manner is so warm, so ardent, that Mrs.
Prior pauses, and her mind starts on another
track. With rapidity her thoughts fly back
and then forward. Crosby is quite as good
a match as Paul, if one excludes the title.
And perhaps—who knows?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘George,’ says she softly, but with emotion,
‘perhaps you think me hard. But a mother—and
that dreadful girl lives there alone
in his house; and he visits her; and can
you still, from your heart, tell me that
she——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She breaks off, as if quite overcome, and
unable to go on.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can tell you this, at all events,’ says
Crosby, ‘that she does not live alone. Wyndham
has engaged a lady to be a companion to
her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Paul!’ Mrs. Prior turns her eyes, moist
with her late emotion, on him—eyes now full
of wrath. ‘Is she an imbecile, then, this
girl? Must Paul engage a keeper for her?
What absurd throwing of dust in the eyes of
the world!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>‘A companion, I said.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She throws him a little contemptuous
glance, and, with agitation, begins to pace up
and down the room. ‘A nice companion!
They are well met, no doubt,’ cries she suddenly,
‘this “companion” and her charge.
I tell you, George, I shall get at the root of
this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think you will have to go very
deep,’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think it is so much on the surface as
that? I don’t. And I shall take measures;
I shall know what to do.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is something so determined in her
air as she says this, that Crosby looks at her
with some consideration. What is she going
to do?</p>

<p class='c004'>But she is looking down upon the carpet,
and is evidently thinking. Yes, she knows
what she will do. She will go to that girl
to-morrow, and tell her plainly what her
position is. She will so speak and so argue,
that if the girl is, as George Crosby pretends
to suppose, a virtuous girl, she will frighten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>her out of her present position. And if she
is what Mrs. Prior, with horrible hope,
determines she is, well, then, no harm will
be done, but the ‘little establishment,’ as she
calls it, will infallibly be broken up. There
is another thought, however. Crosby just
now had spoken almost tenderly of Josephine.
If there is the smallest chance of Crosby’s
being attracted by her, Mrs. Prior feels that
she could stay proceedings with regard to
Paul with a most willing hand. If not?
Any way, there is a whole evening to think
it over.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What do you think of doing?’ asks
Crosby at this moment, a little anxiously.
To attack Wyndham before them all, downstairs?...
That would be abominable!
And yet he would hardly put it beyond
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, that lies in the future,’ says she.
She rises languidly from the chair into which
she has sunk, and smiles at him. ‘I am
afraid I am keeping you from your other
guests.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>‘Not at all—not at all,’ says Crosby
amiably. ‘You are keeping me only from
my man and my tie, and the rest of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He bows himself hurriedly, but amiably,
out of the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘Where jealousie is the jailour, many break the
prison, it opening more wayes to wickedness than it
stoppeth.’</p>

<p class='c010'>It is indeed perilously near the dinner-hour!
Mrs. Prior, after a few words with Josephine—who
had evidently had her dainty ear
applied to the keyhole, and who is distinctly
sulky—has gone downstairs and into the
smaller drawing-room, where she finds a
group on the hearthrug gathered round a
little, but friendly, autumn fire, discussing all
in heaven and earth. They have evidently
come down to earth as she enters, because
the name of Susan Barry is being wafted to
and fro.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>‘Oh, she’s lovely—lovely!’ Lady Forster
is saying with enthusiasm. ‘Such eyes, and
with such a funny expression in them sometimes—sometimes,
when she isn’t so dreadfully
in earnest, as she generally is. After
all, perhaps the earnestness is her charm.
She is certainly the very sweetest thing!
George’—she turns, looks round her, and,
finding Crosby not present, laughs, and
makes a little gesture with her hands—‘George
will never be able to go back to
his niggers.’ In her heart, being devoted to
her only brother, she hopes this will be the
case.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you don’t take care, she will marry your
brother,’ says Miss Prior from her low seat.
She is protecting her complexion from the
light of the big lamp near her by a fan far
bigger than the lamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, why not?’ says Lady Forster, who
detests Josephine.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A girl like that—a mere nobody—the
daughter of an obscure country parson?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not so very obscure!’ says Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Muriel, in her gentle way. ‘Mr. Barry is
very well connected; I have met some of his
people.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, hardly a match for Mr. Crosby.’
Josephine waves her fan lightly, yet with
a suggestion of temper. Her mother, who
has subsided into a seat, listens with an
interest that borders on agitation to the
answer to this speech. On it hangs her
decision about the girl at the Cottage. If
Crosby’s people support Crosby in his infatuation
for that silly child at the Rectory, then—nothing
is left to Josephine.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you know,’ says Lady Forster, ‘I
don’t feel a bit like that. Let us all be
happy, is my motto. I think’—thoughtfully—‘I
am not sure, mind you—but I think if
George wanted to marry a barmaid, or something
like that, I should enter a gentle protest.
But if he has set his heart on this
delightful Susan——Isn’t she a heart,
Muriel? Such a ducky child!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought her delightful, and her brother,
too,’ says Lady Muriel, laughing at Katherine’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>exaggerations. ‘She is decidedly pretty, at
all events. Even more than that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, a great deal more,’ says Captain
Lennox, who has come into the room with
some of the other men.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And of very good family, too,’ says
Lady Millbank, who is dining with them.
The Barrys, as has been said, are a connection
of hers, but always up to this—on account
of their poverty—scarcely acknowledged, and
kept carefully in the shade. But now, with
this brilliant chance of a marriage for Susan,
she is willing to bring them suddenly into
the fuller light.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But penniless,’ puts in Josephine carefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! what do pennies matter?’ says Lady
Forster sweetly, but with a faint grin at her
husband, who is near her. He, too, feels
small affection for the stately Josephine.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And if George fancies her—why, it will
keep him from marrying a squaw. They
don’t call them squaws in Africa, do they?
Something worse, perhaps.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>‘Not much difference,’ says Captain Lennox.
‘But the squaws, as a rule, wear more
clothing than the Zulu ladies, and that might
perhaps——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, good heavens!’ says Lady Forster;
‘it might indeed! If they wear less petticoat
than the dear old squaws——And if he
should bring one here! Fancy her advent
into one’s drawing-room! People would go
away.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think so—I really don’t,’ says
Captain Lennox reassuringly. ‘I believe
honestly you might depend on “people” to
support you under the trying circumstances.
What are friends for, if——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, well, I couldn’t stand it if you could,’
says Lady Forster, with a glance at him.
‘And I don’t want George to marry a nasty
Zulu, any way. What do you think, Billee
Barlow?’—to her husband. ‘Isn’t Susan
nicer than a Zulu woman?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve not had much experience,’ says Sir
William lazily. ‘But I dare say you’re
right.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>‘But listen. Isn’t it better for George to
marry Susan than to go out there again,
and perhaps give you a sister-in-law “mit
nodings” on her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s very startling,’ says Lennox. ‘Take
time, Billee, before answering; you might
commit yourself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Really, the question is,’ says Josephine,
in her cold, settled way, ‘whether it would
be wise to encourage a marriage so distinctly
one-sided in the way of advantage as that
between——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes, yes,’ interrupts Lady Forster
impatiently. ‘But if George goes away again,
I have a horrid feeling that he won’t come
back at all. You see, he is too much one of
us to bring into our midst a dusky bride—and
men have married out there—and if he
likes this charming child and she likes
him——People should always marry for
love, I think, eh, Billee?’—turning to her
husband.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I always think as you do,’ says the wise
man.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>‘Billee Barlow, what an answer!’ She
looks aggrieved, and throws up her little
dainty, fairy-like head. ‘Do you think I’d
have married you if I hadn’t—liked you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Was that why you married me?’ asks he,
laughing, and bent on teasing her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No.’ She turns her back on him. ‘I
don’t know why I married you, except—that
you were the biggest duffer in Europe.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Forster roars.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m glad I’m the biggest,’ says he. ‘It’s
well to be great in one’s own line.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, that’s where it is,’ says Lady
Forster, returning with perfect equanimity
to the original subject. ‘And if it comes
off, Susan will be a perfect sister-in-law.
One has to think of one’s self, you know;
and what I dwell on is, that I’ll have the
greatest fun bringing her out in town. I’ve
thought it all over. She will have a regular
boom. There won’t be a girl next year in it
with her. I know all the coming debutantes,
and she could give them miles and beat
them.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Miss Prior laughs curiously, and Lady
Forster looks at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That you are the most disinterested sister
on earth, or——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The most selfish.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Lady Forster, who is impetuous to a fault,
makes a movement as if to say something
crushing—then restrains herself. After all,
it is her brother’s house; this girl is her
guest.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not selfish,’ says she sweetly. ‘I
have a strange fancy that George adores
her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Strange fancies are not always true,’ says
Miss Prior. ‘Sir William, do you agree
with Katherine about this adoration?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William shrugs his shoulders. How
should he know?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Billee’s a fool,’ says Lady Forster, in
her plaintive voice. ‘Aren’t you, Billee?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My darling, you forget I married you,’
says Forster, in his tragic tone. Whereat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>she rolls her handkerchief into a little ball
and throws it at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Prior, who has sat on a lounge near
the door listening silently to this conversation,
now makes up her mind. There is
nothing to be hoped for from Crosby. To-morrow,
then, she will see this ‘tenant’ of
Paul’s, though all the guardians and chaperons
in Europe rise up to prevent her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But are you really so sure that your
brother is in love with Miss Susan?’ asks
Lennox of Lady Forster, in a low tone,
unheard by the others.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, I’m not,’ declares she, with astounding
frankness. ‘I only wanted to be a tiny
bit nasty to Josephine, who, I’m sure, has
her eye on him in case another complication
fails. No, indeed’—sighing—‘no such luck!
Wanderers like George are like confirmed
gamblers, or drunkards, or that sort of extraordinary
person—they are beyond cure. I’m
sure that, in spite of all that pretty Susan’s
charms, he will go back to his nasty blacks
and his lions and his general tomfoolery.’</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘They begin with making falsehood appear like
truth, and end with making truth appear like falsehood.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Prior knocks gently at the front-gate
of the Cottage, not the little green gate so
well known to the Barrys; and after a little
delay Mrs. Denis’s martial strides can be
heard behind it, and her voice pierces the
woodwork.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who’s there?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is I, Mrs. Prior.’ Mrs. Prior’s tones
are soft and suave and persuasive. ‘That is
you, I think, Mrs. Denis. I recognise your
voice as that of an old friend. I have been
here before, you know, several times, and I
quite remember you. My nephew—your
master, Mr. Wyndham, has at last let me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>know about his tenant, and I have come’—very
softly this—‘to call on her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>That she is lying horribly and with set
purpose is beyond doubt. To herself she excuses
herself with the old, sad, detestable
fallacy, that her words are true, whatever the
spirit of them may be.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Denis, astute matron and alert Cerberus
as she is (a rather comical combination),
is completely taken in. She is the more
ready to be deceived, in that she is at her
heart, good soul! so unfeignedly glad to think
that now, after all this time, her master’s
people are coming forward to recognise, and
no doubt make much of, the ‘purty darlin’’
under her care. Her care. Never for a
moment has she admitted Miss Manning’s
right to chaperon Ella, though now on excellent
terms with that most excellent lady.</p>

<p class='c004'>She does not answer Mrs. Prior immediately,
but strokes her beard behind the
gate, and smiles languidly to herself. Hah!
He’s tould ’em! He’s found out for himself
that he loves her! The crathure! An’ why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>not! Fegs, there isn’t her aqual between this
and the Injies! An’, of course, it is a mark of
honour designed by him to his young lady,
that his aunt should come an’ pay her respects
to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>For all this, she is still cautious, and now
opens the gate to Mrs. Prior by only an inch
or so at a time. Mrs. Prior, on this, calmly
and with the leisurely manner that belongs
to her, moves forward a step or two, a step
that places her parasol and her arm inside
the gateway.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are, I can see, a most faithful guardian,’
says she pleasantly, and with the distinctly
approving tones of the superior to the
efficient inferior. ‘I shall take care to tell
Mr. Wyndham my opinion of you.’ The
little sinister meaning in her speech is clouded
in smiles. She takes another step forward
that brings not only her arm and parasol,
but herself, inside the gate; thus mistress of
the situation, she smiles again—this time a
little differently, but still with the utmost
suavity.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>‘This young lady?’ asks she. ‘She is in
the house, no doubt? If you could let me
see her without any formal introduction, it
would be so much more friendly, it seems to
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Denis’s ample bosom swells with joy
and pride. Her beard vibrates. ‘Friendly.’
So they are going to be friendly—those
people of his! After all, perhaps Miss Ella
is a princess in disguise, and they have only
just found it out. ‘Well, she looks one—wid
her little feet, an’ her little hands, an’ those
small features of hers.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, ma’am,’ says she, addressing Mrs.
Prior with a courtesy she seldom uses to
anyone. ‘Miss Ella is in the garding; an’
as you say ye’d like to see her all be yerself,
if ye’ll go round that corner ye’ll find her
aisy, near the hollyhocks. An’ I’ll tell ye
this,’ says Mrs. Denis, squaring her arms,
and growing sentimental, ‘’tis plazed ye’ll be
whin ye do see her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I feel sure of that,’ says Mrs. Prior. She
speaks quite calmly, yet a rage of hatred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>shakes her. Glad to see this abominable
creature, who has interfered with the marriage
of her daughter!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She’s got the face of an angel, ma’am.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And the heart of one, of course,’ says
Mrs. Prior. The sarcasm is thrown away
upon Mrs. Denis, who is now bursting with a
pæan addressed to her goddess.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ay, ma’am. Fegs, ’tis aisy to see the
masther has bin’ tellin’ you about her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just a little,’ says Mrs. Prior. ‘He——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He thinks a dale of her,’ says Mrs. Denis,
putting her hand to her mouth, and speaking
mysteriously. ‘I can see that much, but ’tis
little he says. But sure, ye know him. ’Tis
mighty quiet he is entirely.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I think I know him. But this&#160;...
young lady——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Wisha! ’tis only keepin’ ye from her I am.
An’ ’tis longin’ ye are to see her, ov course.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are right, my good woman,’ says
Mrs. Prior; ‘I really don’t think I was ever
so anxious to make the acquaintance of anyone
before.... Round that corner, you say?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Thank you. I shall certainly tell my nephew
what a trustworthy guardian you make.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She parts with Mrs. Denis with a little
gracious bow, and a sudden swift change of
countenance that strikes that worthy woman
at the time—but unfortunately works out a
little late. Stepping quickly in the direction
indicated, Mrs. Prior turns the corner and
goes along the southern border of the pretty
cottage until she reaches a small iron gate
that leads to the garden proper.</p>

<p class='c004'>In here, soft perfumes meet one in the air,
and delicate tints delight the eye. The little
walks run here and there, the grasses grow,
and from the flowering shrubs sweet trills
are heard, sounds beautiful, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘Not sooner heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Than answered, doubled, trebled more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Voice of an Eden in the bird,</div>
      <div class='line'>Renewing with his pipe of four</div>
      <div class='line'>The sob; a troubled Eden, rich</div>
      <div class='line'>In throb of heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The grandeur of the dying autumn strikes
through all; for over there, as a background
to the still brilliant flowers, are fading yellows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and sad reds, and leaves russet-brown, more
lovely now, perhaps, than when a life dwelt
in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Prior moves through all these things
untouched by their beauty—on one thought
bent. And all at once the subject of her
thought lies there before her. The clearest,
sweetest thought!</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella, on one of the many small paths, is
standing as if struck by some great surprise.
She is looking at Mrs. Prior earnestly, half
fearfully, with eager searching in her large
dark eyes, as of one trying to work out some
problem that had been suggested many years
ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sight of the girl, standing there with
her hand pressed against her forehead as if
to compel thought, drives the anger she is
feeling even deeper into Mrs. Prior’s soul.
Such an attitude! As if not understanding!
The absurd put-on innocence of it is positively—well,
disgusting!</p>

<p class='c004'>And always Ella stands looking at her,
as if frightened by the sudden unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>visitor, but presently through her fear and
astonishment another look springs into life.
Her eyes widen—she does nothing, she says
nothing, but anyone looking on would say
that the girl all at once had remembered.
But something terribly vague had touched
her—something startling out of the past that
until that moment had lain dead. Oh, surely
she knows this lady, has met her somewhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>As if impelled by this mad fancy, she goes
quickly towards Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—do I know you?’ asks she, in a low
tense way.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think not,’ says Mrs. Prior, in her calm
<i><span lang="it">trainante</span></i> voice, that is now insolent to a
degree. A faint, most cruel smile plays upon
her lips. ‘You, and such as you, are seldom
known by—us.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stands silent. No actual knowledge
of her meaning enters into her heart,
but what does come home to her in some
vague way is that she has been thrust back—put
far away—cast out, as it were.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>‘I don’t understand,’ says she, a little
faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I think you do,’ says Mrs. Prior, with
cultivated rudeness. ‘But I have not come
here to-day to inform you as to your position
in life. I have come rather to explain to
you that your—er—relations with my nephew
must come to an end—and at once.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your nephew?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Has Mr. Wyndham not spoken to you of
his people, then? Rather better taste than
I should have expected from him. But one
may judge from it that he is not yet lost to
all sense of decency.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The insolence in her tone stings.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You must believe me or not, as you like,’
says the girl, drawing up her slight figure,
‘but I don’t know what you are speaking
about. Do you mean that you think it wrong
of me to have rented this cottage from Mr.
Wyndham?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Prior raises her pince-nez and looks
at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Really, you are very amusing!’ says she.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>‘Now what do you think it is? Right?
Your views should be interesting.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If not this house, I should take another,’
says Ella. She is feeling bewildered and
frightened, and has grown very pale.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course, if you insist on the innocent
<em>rôle</em>,’ says Mrs. Prior coldly, shrugging her
shoulders, ‘it is useless my wasting my time.
If, however, you have any regard for Mr.
Wyndham, who, it seems, has been very
kind to you’—she glances meaningly round
the charming little home and garden—‘if
distinctly unkind to himself, it may be of
use to let you know that your presence
here is very likely to be the cause of his
ruin.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘His—ruin!’ The unmistakable horror in
the girl’s face strikes Mrs. Prior as hopeful,
so she proceeds briskly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Social ruin! It will undoubtedly mean
his disinheritance by his uncle, Lord Shangarry,
and—the rupture of his engagement
with the girl he—loves!’</p>

<p class='c004'>She plants this barb with joy. The telling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of a lie more or less has never troubled her
during her life.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The girl he loves!’ Ella’s voice as she
repeats the words sounds dull and monotonous.
She is quite ghastly now, and she has
laid her hand on the back of a garden-chair
to steady herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes. The girl he has always meant to
marry!’ She lays great stress on the last
word. That ought to tell. ‘Whom he
meant to marry until your—fascinations’—she
throws detestable meaning into her
speech, base as it is detestable—‘alienated
him—for the moment!’</p>

<p class='c004'>All at once Ella recovers herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you are wrong, wrong!’ cries she
vehemently. ‘Somebody has been telling
you what is not true, what is not the case!
Mr. Wyndham does not—does not’—she
trembles violently—‘love me. Not me—anyone
but me. Oh! who could have said
such a thing? Believe me, do believe me’—she
comes forward, holding out her hands imploringly—‘when
I tell you that I am the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>last girl in the world he would fall in love
with. If you know this young lady he loves,
go back to her, I implore you, and tell her
it is all untrue—that he loves her, and her
only, and that all she has heard to the contrary
is not worth one thought. Oh, madam!
If he should be hurt through me!...
After all his goodness to me! Oh&#160;...
go&#160;... go to her and tell her what I
say!’</p>

<p class='c004'>She stops, and covers her face suddenly
with her hands. She is not crying, however.
Tears are far from her eyes. But the misery
of death has swept over her soul.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Prior gives way to a low laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why didn’t you go on the stage?’ she
says. ‘You would have made even a better
living there. But perhaps you have only
just come off it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl lets her hand drop to her sides,
and turns passionately upon her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why won’t you believe me?’ cries she,
with sudden wild vehemence. ‘What have
I done that you should disbelieve my word?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Her eyes are bright with grief and the eager
desire that is consuming her to make things
straight for Wyndham and the girl he loves.
Wyndham, who has been so good to her, who
has brought her out of such deep waters!
To hurt him—to injure him: the very
thought is unbearable. She has involuntarily—unknowingly—drawn
up her <i><span lang="fr">svelte</span></i>
and slender body to its fullest height, and
with a courage that few women could have
found under circumstances so poignant, so
filled with agonized memory, and with yet
another feeling that perhaps is bitterest of
all (though hardly known), she looks full at
her tormentor.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Can’t you see,’ cries she, with a proud
humility, ‘how wrong you must be? How
could I interfere between Mr. Wyndham and
the woman he loves? Who am I? Nothing!’
She throws up her beautiful head with a
touch of inalienable pride, and repeats the
word distinctly: ‘Nothing!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Less than nothing,’ says Mrs. Prior, who
is only moved to increased and unendurable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>hatred by her beauty and her unconscious
hauteur. ‘So far as he regards you!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella draws her breath quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If so small in his regard, how then do
I prevent his marriage with the girl he
loves?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Alas for the sorrow of her voice! It
might have touched the heart of anyone.
Mrs. Prior, however, is impervious to such
touches.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t you think it very absurd, your pretending
like this?’ says she contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course, in spite of the absurd innocence
you pretend, one can see that you quite
understand the situation, and how unpleasantly
you are in the way. If he had
brought you anywhere but here, it might
have been hushed up, but to the very house
his poor mother left him—why, it is an open
scandal, and an insult to my daughter!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl makes a shocked gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is your daughter, then? But’—quickly—‘now
you know he doesn’t love me,
and you can tell her—and——’ She is looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>eagerly, with almost passionate hope, at
Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tell her! Tell my daughter about you!’
Mrs. Prior’s voice is terrible. ‘How dare
you suggest the idea of my speaking to my
girl of——’ She checks herself with difficulty,
and goes on coldly: ‘No doubt you
believe Mr. Wyndham will be to you always
as he is now. Women of your class delude
themselves like that. But—when he marries—as
he will—as he shall—you will learn that
a wife is one thing and a mis——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She breaks off in the middle of her odious
word as though shot. A hand has grasped
her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hould yer tongue, woman, if there’s still
a dhrop o’ dacency left in ye! Hould yer
tongue, I say!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The voice is the voice of Mrs. Denis.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘May I ask who it is you are addressing?’
asks Mrs. Prior, releasing herself easily
enough. Putting up her eyeglass, she bends
upon Mrs. Denis the glare that she has
always found so effectual for the undoing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>her foes. But Mrs. Denis thinks nothing of
glares. She is, indeed, at this moment producing
one of her own, beneath which Mrs.
Prior’s sinks into insignificance.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Faith ye may!’ says she, advancing towards
the enemy with a regular ‘come on’
sort of air. ‘An’ as ye ask me, I’ll give ye
yer answer. Ye’re the aunt of a nevvy that
has ivery right to be ashamed o’ ye! Know
ye, is it? Arrah!’ Here the unapproachable
sarcasm of the Irish peasant breaks
forth. ‘Is it that ye’re askin’? Fegs, I
do, thin, an’ to me cost, for ’tis too late I am
wid me knowledge.’ She pauses here, and
planting her hands on her ample hips, surveys
Mrs. Prior with deliberate scorn.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, ye ould thraitor!’ says she at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tableau!</p>

<p class='c004'>It is open to question whether Mrs. Prior’s
instant anger arises most from the word
‘ould’ or ‘thraitor.’ Probably the ‘ould.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You forget yourself!’ cries she sharply,
furiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ye’re out there,’ says Mrs. Denis; ‘for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>’tis I’m remimberin’. “Oh, Mrs. Denis”’—with
a wonderful attempt at Mrs. Prior’s air—‘“an’
is that you?”—so swate like. An’,
“I’ll be tellin’ me nevvy what a good
guardian ye are.” An’, “’Tis me nevvy tould
me to come an’ pay me respecks to your
young lady.”’ Here Mrs. Denis lifts her
powerful fist and shakes it in the air. ‘I
wondher to the divil,’ says she, ‘that yer
tongue didn’t sthick to yer mouth whin ye
said thim words. Yer nevvy indeed! Wait
till I see yer nevvy! ’Tis shakin’ in yer
shoes ye’ll be thin! Worse than ye made
this poor lamb’—with a glance at Ella, who
has drawn back and is trembling violently—‘shake
to-day.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You shall have reason to remember this—this
most insolent behaviour. You shall
know——’ begins Mrs. Prior, white with
wrath; but Mrs. Denis will have none of her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know one thing, any way,’ says she,
‘that out ov this ye go, this minnit-second.
Ye can tell yer nevvy all about it whin ye
git out, an’ the sooner ye’re out, the sooner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>ye can tell him; an’ I wish ye joy of the
tellin’! Come now!’—she steps up to Mrs.
Prior with a menacing air—‘quick march!’</p>

<p class='c004'>This grand old soldier—with whom even
her husband, good man and true as he had
proved himself on many a battlefield, would
probably have come off second best at a close
tussle—now sidling up to Mrs. Prior with
distinct battle in her eyes, that lady deems
it best to lay down her arms and sound a
retreat.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘This disreputable conduct only coincides
with the whole of this establishment,’ says
Mrs. Prior, making a faint effort to sustain
her position whilst being literally moved towards
the gate by the powerful personality
and still more powerful arm of Mrs. Denis.
The latter does not touch her, indeed, but
she keeps waving that muscular member up
and down like a windmill, in a most threatening
manner. ‘You understand that I shall
report all this to Mr. Wyndham?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ye’ve said all that before,’ says Mrs.
Denis, with great contempt. ‘An’ now I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>tell you something. That report ye spake
of, in my humble opinion, will make mighty
little noise!’</p>

<p class='c004'>After that she closes the gate with scant
ceremony on Mrs. Prior’s departing heels.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Prior, thus forcibly ejected (ejections
are the vogue in Ireland), commences her
return journey to Crosby Park, smarting considerably
under her wrongs and the big
umbrella she is holding over her head. She
has gone but a little way, however, when,
on suddenly turning a corner, she finds herself
face to face with Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>He has evidently been walking in a great
hurry, but as he sees her he comes to a dead
stop. All his worst fears are at once realized.
The fact is that Crosby had missed Mrs.
Prior at luncheon hour—a most unusual
thing, by the way, for her to be absent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>for she dearly loved a meal—and he had
asked Miss Prior where she was. Miss Prior
had said she did not know—hadn’t the
faintest notion—perhaps gone for a prowl
and forgotten her way home. Crosby somehow
had felt that the fair Josephine was
lying openly and freely, and had at once
given a hint to Wyndham of Mrs. Prior’s
conversation with him on the previous night,
even suggesting that Mrs. Prior’s unusual
absence from luncheon might have some
connection with the Cottage. The result
of all of which is that Mrs. Prior now finds
herself looking into her nephew’s eyes and
wondering rather vaguely what the next
move is going to be.</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes are distinctly unpleasant. They
had been anxious—horribly anxious—when
first she saw them; but now they seem alive
with active rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where have you been?’ asks he immediately,
his face set and white. Crosby, then,
had been quite right in his suggestion.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have been doing my duty,’ returns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Mrs. Prior, who has pulled herself together.
Her tone is stern and uncompromising.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have been at the Cottage?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have guessed quite correctly.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have seen that poor girl, then,
and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have seen that most wretched girl, and
told her my opinion of her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham makes a sharp ejaculation. ‘You
spoke to her, insulted her, that poor child?’
He feels that reproach is no longer possible
to him. What has she said? What, indeed,
has she left unsaid? Great heavens, what
monsters some women can be!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I explained to her her position. Not that
she needed explanation, in spite of all her
extremely clever efforts at an innocent bearing.
I passed over that, however, and told
her—hoping that perhaps she had some real
feeling for you, though I understand that
class of person never has any honest feeling—that
beyond all doubt Lord Shangarry
would disinherit you if he heard of your
connection with her.’ She pauses here. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>is her trump card, and she looks straight
at Paul as she plays it.</p>

<p class='c004'>It proves valueless. He passes it over as
though it were of no consequence whatever.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know what to say to you,’ says
he, struggling with his passionate rage, and
grief, and shame. ‘I hardly know how to
condemn you strongly enough. I wish to
God you were not a woman, and then I
should know what to do. This girl you have
so insulted is a girl as good and pure as the
best girl you have ever met, and yet you
have gone down there’—pointing in the
direction of the Cottage—‘and deliberately
hurt and wounded her. I wonder you had
the courage to do it. Are you’—growing
now furious—‘a fool that you couldn’t see
how sweet and gentle and innocent she is?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is it your intercourse with this sweet and
gentle and innocent girl that has made you
so extremely rude?’ asks his aunt in her low,
well-bred voice. ‘If so, I consider I have done
an extra duty by my visit to her. It may
have results. Your disinheritance by Shangarry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>for example, is sure to have an effect
upon her. I am afraid, after all, it is you
who are the fool. In the meantime, Paul, I
can quite see that your infatuation for an
extremely ordinary sort of girl has blinded
you to her defects. Some of these people, I
am told, quite study our manners nowadays;
but she lacks distinction of any sort. That
you happen to be in love with her at present
of course prevents your seeing these faults.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You seem so remarkably well up in the
affair,’ says Wyndham, who could now have
cheerfully strangled her, ‘that I suppose it
will be quite superfluous to tell you that love
has no voice in the matter. I am not in love
with her, and she most positively is not in
love with me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Prior makes a contemptuous movement
of her thin shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So very old,’ says she. ‘Do you suppose,
my dear Paul, with the stake you have in
view, that I expected you to say the truth—to
tell me that you had fallen violently in
love with this little paltry creature, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>come out of no one knows where, except
yourself, to go back to no one knows where
when you are tired of her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Look here,’ says Wyndham, driven beyond
all courtesy by some feeling that he can
hardly explain, ‘I think you have the worst
mind of any woman I have ever met. I see
now that it is useless to try to convince you;
but remember—remember always’—he makes
a distinct pause, as if on purpose, as if to
fasten the words on her mind—‘what I say
to you now—that anyone who calls Ella
Moore anything less than the best woman
on earth—lies!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your infatuation has gone deep,’ says
Mrs. Prior. ‘Few men would speak so
strongly in favour of the virtue of their—friends.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I understand your hideous hint,’ says
Wyndham, who has now grown cold and
collected. ‘You are a woman, and it is
hard to tell a woman that she lies. But if
you were a man, I shouldn’t hesitate about
it.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>‘As I tell you, she has not improved your
manners,’ says Mrs. Prior, with a bitter
smile. She has not dreamt the affair would
take this turn. She has believed that Paul,
through dread of Shangarry’s displeasure,
would at the most have made light of the
matter, have parried the attack, and perhaps
have sworn fresh allegiance to Josephine on
the head of it. That he should defend this
‘creature’ and defy her, his aunt, because of
her—— The situation has become strained
beyond bearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you do not love her, and she does not
love you, and is not even your friend,’ says
she sneeringly, ‘what is she to you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My tenant—neither more nor less.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mean to tell me, on your honour, that
she pays you rent?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly she does.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is a <i><span lang="fr">bonâ-fide</span></i> tenant, nothing more?
Then, if so, why all this mystery? Why did
you give me to understand weeks ago that
she was a man?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You understood that for yourself. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>with regard to the mystery, it seems that
she is desirous of privacy.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How very modest, and what an extraordinary
tenant to pick up! May I ask
where you first heard of her? By advertisement?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment Wyndham hesitates. Hesitation
is supposed to lead to ruin, but Wyndham
comes out of it sound in wind and limb.
His mind had suffered a shock as it fell
back upon that tragic scene in the Professor’s
room, but recovered from it almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You may have heard of Professor Hennessy,’
says he—‘a very distinguished man.
He told me of her just before his death.
Now’—sarcastically—‘have I answered
enough of your questions? Is your conscience
quite satisfied as to your duty?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is open to anyone to make light of
sacred subjects,’ said Mrs. Prior, with
dignity. ‘Duty to me is the one sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>thing in life. I have taken this matter in
hand, and, in spite of all you have said, Paul,
I may as well warn you that I shall not take
your word for it, but shall sift it steadily
to the bottom. I consider that my duty to
both you and to my daughter.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To Josephine?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, to Josephine. Are you prepared to
say that you have no duty towards her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not that I am aware of.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘After all these years? After all Shangarry
has hinted and said? After all the
notoriety, the talk, the gossip, of our world?
That a man should pay pointed attentions to
a girl for two years—should come and go, be
received at her mother’s house, and escort
her to balls and concerts and to theatres—is
all that to go for nothing? Is my poor girl
to be cast aside now as though nothing had
occurred——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you are alluding to Josephine,’ says
Wyndham coldly and calmly, ‘I can’t see
that anything has occurred to cause her
annoyance of any kind. I am afraid you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>misleading yourself. You ought to speak to
your daughter, and she, no doubt, will post
you up about it. I, for my part, can assure
you that there is nothing between us, nor
has there ever been. Your daughter is as
indifferent to me as’—emphatically—‘I am
to her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He feels abominably rude as he says this,
but he feels, too, the necessity for saying it.
And, after all, the onus of the rudeness lies
with her. Mrs. Prior is silent for a moment,
more from anger than from inability to speak;
then she breaks out:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall write to Shangarry.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can write,’ says Wyndham quietly,
‘to anyone on earth you like.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You distinctly, then, decline to carry out
your engagement to my daughter?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear aunt, surely you exaggerate?
When was there any engagement?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was the same thing. You paid her
great attention, and Shangarry has set his
heart on it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am sorry for Lord Shangarry.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>‘You refuse, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Distinctly,’ says Wyndham. He lifts his
hat and hurries past her. She waits a little,
watching him until he disappears round the
corner that will lead him to the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c010'>He finds Ella standing, where she had stood
throughout her interview with Mrs. Prior,
beneath a big horse-chestnut-tree in the
garden. She had resisted all Miss Manning’s
entreaties to come indoors and lie down and
have a cup of tea (that kind woman’s one
unfailing recipe for all diseases and griefs
under the sun), and had only entreated
piteously that she might be left alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, as she hears Wyndham’s step upon
the gravel, she lifts her head, and the white
misery of her face, as he sees it, makes his
heart swell with wrath within him. Great
heavens! what had that fiend said to her?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>He struggles with an almost ungovernable
desire to go to her and press those poor
forlorn eyes against his breast, if only to
shut them out from his vision; and he
struggles, too, it must be confessed—not so
successfully—with a wild longing to give way
to bad language. A few words escape him,
breathed low, but extremely pungent. They
bring some faint relief; but still his heart
burns within him, and, indeed, he himself is
surprised at the intensity of his emotion.</p>

<p class='c004'>She does not speak, and he does not attempt
to shake hands with her. It is impossible
for him to forget that it is his own
aunt who has thus wantonly insulted her—who
has brought this terrible look into her
young face. She, who has known so much
suffering, who is now, indeed, only slowly
recovering from a life unutterably sad.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know it all,’ begins he hurriedly, disconnectedly—he,
the cold, clever barrister.
‘I met her just now, just outside the gate.
She is a woman of a most vindictive temper.
I hope you will not let anything she may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>have said dwell for a moment in your memory.
It is not worth it, believe me. She is unscrupulous.’
He is almost out of breath
now, but still hurries on. ‘She would do
anything to gain a point. She——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are talking of your aunt,’ says Ella
at last in a stifled tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; and God knows,’ says he, with
vehement bitterness, ‘there was never anyone
more ashamed to acknowledge anything
than I am to acknowledge her. You—you
will try to forget what she said——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Forget! Every word,’ says the girl, lifting
her hands and pressing the palms against
her pretty head, ‘seems beaten in here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But such words—so false, so meaningless—the
words of a malicious woman, used to
gain her own purpose——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, they are here,’ says she wearily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For the moment; but in time you will
forget, not only her words, but her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Her! I shall never forget her!’ She
turns to him with quick questioning in her
eyes. ‘Is she really your aunt, Mr. Wyndham?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>It is strange—it is impossible—but I
know I have seen her before. In my dreams
sometimes, now, I see her. But in my
dreams she does not look as she did to-day.’
She shudders, and presses her fingers against
her eyes, as if to shut out something. ‘She
is lovely there, and kind, and so beautiful;
and she calls me “Ellie.” I must be going
mad, I think,’ cries she abruptly. ‘A brain
diseased sees queer things; and when I saw
her in the Rectory garden yesterday, all at
once it came to me that I knew her—that I
had seen her before. Perhaps’—she goes
closer to him, and examines his face with
interest, marking every line, as it were,
every feature, until Wyndham begins to
wish that his parents had granted him better
looks, and then, ‘No, no,’ says she, sighing.
‘I thought perhaps it was her likeness to you
that made her face seem familiar. But you
are not like her. She’—sighing again—‘is
very handsome.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a distinct ‘takedown.’ Wyndham,
however, bears up nobly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>‘No,’ says he; ‘I am grateful to say that I
resemble my father’s family, plain though
they may be. The Burkes, of course, were
always considered very handsome.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Burke?’ She looks at him again, and
frowns a little, as if again memory is troubling
her. ‘The Burkes were——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My mother was a daughter of Sir John
Burke.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes; I see. And the lady who was
here just now, Mrs.——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Prior.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was a daughter, too?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I regret to say so—yes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, my dreams are wrong,’ says she, as
if half to herself. ‘And yet——’ She breaks
off.</p>

<p class='c004'>She moves away from him, and in an idle,
inconsequent way, pulls at the shrubs and
flowers near her. He can see at once that
she is thinking, wrestling with the troubled
waters of her mind, and there is something
in the dignity and sadness of the young figure
that appeals to him, and awakens afresh that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>eager desire to help her that has been his
from the first.</p>

<p class='c004'>After awhile she comes back to him, her
hands full of the late flowers that she nervously
pulls from finger to finger in an unconscious
fashion.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can’t live here any longer,’ says she.
‘I should not have come here at all. She
has quite shown me that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have already told you that not one word
Mrs. Prior said is worthy of another thought.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He is alluding to Mrs. Prior’s abominable
suggestions as to the real meaning of the
girl’s presence in the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Wyndham,’ says Ella, resting her
earnest eyes on his, ‘perhaps I have never
let you fully understand how I regard all you
have done for me—how grateful I am to you—a
mere waif, a nobody. But I am grateful,
and, believe me, the one thing that has cut
me to the very heart to-day is the thought
that I—I’—with poignant meaning—‘should
be the one to cause dissension between you
and—and—and her.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>‘Her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes; she told me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She? Who? Her?’ This involved sentence
is taken no notice of.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was your aunt who told me. But you
can explain to her——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To her! To whom? My aunt?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, no, no!’ She pauses. ‘Surely you
know.’ At this moment something in the
girl’s air makes Wyndham feel that she is
believing him guilty of a desire to play the
hypocrite—to conceal something. ‘It cannot
have gone so very far,’ says she miserably.
‘A few words from you to her——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To “her” again? If not my aunt,’ demands
he frantically, ‘what her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She looks at him with sad astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I see now you wouldn’t trust me,’ says
she. Her eyes are suffused with tears. She
turns aside, her hands tightly clenched, as if
in pain. Then all at once she breaks out.
‘Oh,’ cries she passionately, ‘why didn’t you
tell her at first?’ Tell her at first! Who
the deuce is ‘her’? ‘Or even me. If’—miserably—‘if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>I had known, I should not
have come here, and then there would have
been no trouble, no wondering, no mystery;
and there would have been no misunderstanding
between you and’—she draws a sharp
breath—‘the girl you love!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good heavens! Do I find myself in
Bedlam?’ cries Wyndham, who is not by any
means an even-tempered man, and who now
has lost the last rag of self-control. ‘What
girl do I love?’</p>

<p class='c004'>But his burst of rage seems to take small
effect on Ella.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course,’ says she, in a stifled tone,
directing her attention now to a bush near
her, plucking hurriedly at its leaves, ‘if you
wish to keep it a secret—and you know I
said you didn’t trust me—and, of course, if
you wish to’—her voice here sounds broken—‘to
tell me nothing, you are right—quite
right. There is no reason why I should be
let into your confidence.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Look here,’ says Wyndham roughly. He
catches her arm and compels her to turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>round. ‘Let’s get to the bottom of this
matter. What did my aunt tell you? Come
now! Out with it straight and plain.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He has occasionally entreated his clients
to be honest, but usually with very poor
results. Now, however, he finds one to
answer him even more straightly than he
had at all bargained for. Ella flings up her
head. Perhaps she had objected to that
magisterial ‘Come now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She said you were in love with her
daughter, and that you had meant to marry
her, until—my being here interfered with it.
She’—the girl pauses, and regards him
anxiously, as if looking to him for an explanation—‘didn’t
say how I interfered.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She said that?’ Wyndham’s voice is full
of suppressed but violent rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, that, and a great deal more,’ she
goes on now vehemently. ‘That my being
here would ruin you. That some lord—your
uncle—your grand-uncle—Shan—Shanbally
or garry was the name’—striving wildly with
her memory—‘would disinherit you because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>you had let your cottage to me. But that
wasn’t just, was it? Why shouldn’t you let
your house to me as well as to anybody else,
Mr. Wyndham?’—with angry intonation.
‘Is that three hundred a year the Professor
left me mine really? Did he leave it to me
at all? Oh! if he didn’t—if I am indebted
to you for all this comfort, this happiness——’
She breaks down.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are entitled to that money; I swear
it!’ says Wyndham. ‘His very last words
were of you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are sure! Of course, if not——That
might be the reason for their all being
angry with me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She is so very far off the actual truth that
Wyndham hesitates before replying to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am quite sure,’ says he presently. ‘The
money is yours.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then I do not understand your aunt,’
cries she, throwing up her small head proudly.
‘She said a great many other things that I
thought very rude—at least, I’m sure they
were meant to be rude by her air. But they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>were so stupid that no one could understand
them. I hardly remember them. I only
remember those about——’ She breaks off
suddenly; tears rise in her saddened eyes.
‘I wish—I wish,’ cries she, in an agonized
tone, ‘you had told me that you loved her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Loved her! Josephine!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is that her name—your cousin’s name?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, and a most detestable name it is.’
There is frank disgust in his tone. The girl
watches him wistfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps, after all,’ says she—she hesitates,
and the hand on the rose-bush now
trembles, though Wyndham never sees it—‘perhaps
it wasn’t your cousin she meant. I
misunderstood her, I dare say. It’—she
looks at him with eager, searching young
eyes—‘it was someone else, perhaps——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Someone else?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are in love with.’ She draws back
a little, almost leaning against the rose-bush
now, and looking up at him from under
frightened brows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am in love with no one,’ says Wyndham,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>with much directness—‘with no one in the
wide world.’ He quite believes himself as he
says this. But, in spite of this belief, a sensation
of discontent pervades him, as, looking
at the girl, he sees a smile, wide and happy,
spreading over her charming face. Evidently
it is nothing to her. She has had no desire
that he should be in love with—her. ‘There
is one thing,’ says he, a little austerely—that
smile is still upon her face—‘if you really
desire privacy, you should be careful about
letting yourself be seen. Yesterday, in that
tree,’ he points towards it, and Ella colours
in a little sad, ashamed way that goes to his
heart, but does not disturb his determination
to read her a lecture, ‘you laid yourself open
to discovery, and therefore to insult. The
getting up into a tree or looking at people is
nothing,’ argues he coldly. ‘It is the fact
that, though you wish to look at people, you
refuse to let them look at you, that makes
the mischief. Anyone in this narrow society
of ours who decides on withdrawing herself
from the public gaze is open to misconception—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>gossip—and finally to insult. I warned
you of that long ago.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I will not—I cannot. You know I cannot
go out of this without great fear and danger,’
says Ella faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know nothing of the kind. This determination
of yours to shut yourself away from
the world is only a species of madness, and it
will grow upon you. Supposing that man
found you, what could he do?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, don’t, don’t!’ says she faintly. She
covers her eyes with her hands. Then suddenly
she takes them down and looks at him.
‘You have never felt fear,’ says she. She
says this quickly, reproachfully, almost angrily;
but through all the anger and reproach
and haste there runs a thread of admiration.
‘But I have. And I tell you if—that man—were
to see me again—were to come here
and order me to go away with him—I should
not dare to refuse.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He knows better than to come here,’ says
Wyndham curtly. ‘You may dispose of that
fear.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>‘Ah!’ says she, sighing, ‘you don’t know
him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know—if not him individually—his
class,’ says Wyndham confidently. ‘Give
up, I counsel you, this secrecy of yours. See
what it has brought upon you to-day. And
these insults will continue. I warn you’—he
looks at her with a frowning brow—‘I
warn you they will continue.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She?’ Ella looks at him timidly. ‘You
think she will come again?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Prior?’—contemptuously; ‘no. But
there will be others. What do you think
people are saying?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Saying of me?’ She looks frightened.
‘They have heard about that night at the
Professor’s?’ questions she. She looks now
almost on the verge of fainting. ‘Your aunt—she—did
she know? She said nothing.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No. She knows nothing of that,’ says
Wyndham hurriedly. After all, it is impossible
to explain to her. But Miss Manning
will know—she will know what to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She only saw me in the tree,’ says the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>girl, with a voice that is now half sobbing.
And then she thought you—that I—oh!’—more
wretchedly still—‘I don’t know what
she thought! But’—trembling—‘I wish I
had never climbed into that tree.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Because she happened to see you? Never
mind that. She’s got eyes in the back of her
head; no one could escape her,’ says he,
touched by her agitation.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not thinking of her,’ says Ella
proudly, making a gesture that might almost
be called imperious. ‘I am only vexed because
you are angry with me about it. But’—eagerly—‘I
never thought anyone would
find me out, and I did so want to see what
you—what’—quickly correcting herself and
colouring faintly—‘you were all doing in the
Rectory garden.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you want so much, and so naturally,’
says he, ‘to see your fellow-people, why didn’t
you accept Susan’s invitation? It would
have prevented all this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know. But I couldn’t,’ says she, hanging
her pretty head. ‘You know I tried it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>once, and it was only when I got back again
here—here into this safe, safe place—that I
knew how frightened I had been all the time.
And you may remember how I fancied then,
on my return, that I had seen——’ She
stops as if unable to go on.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know. I remember. But that was a
mere hallucination, I am sure. You must
try to conquer such absurd fears. Promise
me you will try.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I will try,’ cries she impulsively. She
holds out to him her hand, and he takes it.
‘I will indeed. You have been so good to
me, that I ought to do something for you.
But all the same’—shaking her head—‘I
know you are vexed with me about this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For your sake only. This abominable
visit of my aunt’s, for example——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; about the girl you——’ She stops
and withdraws her hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought I had explained that,’ says he,
with a laugh. ‘But what troubles me is
the thought that you may be again annoyed
in this way. Not by her; I shall see about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>that’—with force. ‘But there may be others.
And of course your welfare is’—he checks
himself—‘of some consequence to me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is it?’ She has grown cold too. ‘Your
aunt’s welfare must be something to you as
well.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean by that that you don’t
think I am on your side?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She lifts her heavy lids and looks at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You told me that my affairs were nothing
to you—that they did not concern you in
the smallest degree.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Was that—some time ago?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes. Almost at first.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t you think it is a little vindictive
to visit one’s former utterances upon one
now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, good-bye,’ says he quickly. He
turns, wounded more than he could have
believed it possible to be by a girl who is
positively nothing to him. Nothing! he
quite insists on this as he goes down the
path.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>But now—what is this? Swift feet running
after him; a small eager hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Wyndham! Don’t go away like
this. If I have offended you, I am sorry; I’—her
lips begin to tremble now, and the
eyes that are uplifted to his are dim—‘I am
dreadfully sorry. Oh, don’t go away like
this! Forgive me!’ Suddenly she bursts
into tears. ‘Do forgive me!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Forgive? I? It is you who have to forgive,’
stammers he. ‘Ella!’</p>

<p class='c004'>He has laid his hand upon hers to draw
them from her eyes, but with a sudden movement
she breaks from him and runs back to
the house. At the door, however, she stops,
and glances back at him, and he can see that
her face is radiant now, though her eyes are
still wet with their late tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye! Good-bye!’ cries she. She
raises both her hands to her lips, and in the
prettiest, the most graceful fashion flings
him a last farewell. This manner of hers is
new to him. It is full, not only of friendliness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>but of the joy of one who has been restored
once more to happiness.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>On the avenue of Crosby Park Wyndham
meets the master of it, who has plainly been
strolling this way with a view to meeting
him on his return.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well!’ says Crosby. Then, seeing the
other’s face, ‘I was right, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You were. She had made her way in,
and insulted the poor child in the most
violent way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I felt sure she was up to mischief,’ says
Crosby, colouring hotly; he, too, is conscious
of strong resentment. That anyone should
go from his house to deliberately annoy a
girl—a young girl, and one so sadly circumstanced—makes
his usually easy-going blood
boil. ‘I thought her manner to you at breakfast
was over-suave. Well?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is hardly anything to tell you.
That she was there, that she spoke as few
women would have had the heart to do, is all
I am sure of. No; this more: that that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>poor child, thank God! didn’t understand
half of her vile insinuations. I could see
so much. But she was cut to the heart, for
all that. If you could have seen her face,
so white, so frightened! I tell you this,
Crosby——’</p>

<p class='c004'>He never told him, however. He broke
off short—as if not able to trust his voice,
and Crosby, after one sharp glance at him,
bestowed all his attention on the gravel at
his feet. And as he waited for the other to
recover his serenity, he shook his head over
the whole affair. Yes, this was always the
end of this sort of thing. If Wyndham didn’t
know it, he did. Wyndham was desperately
in love with this ‘waif’ of his—with this girl
who had sprung out of nowhere, who had
been flung upon his hands out of the angry
tide of life. Presently, seeing Wyndham
continuing silent, as if lost in a train of
thought, he breaks in.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How did you know Mrs. Prior was there?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘From herself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What! you met her?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>‘Just outside the gate.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And’—Crosby here shows signs of hopeful
joy—‘had it out with her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On the spot. She denied nothing. Rather
led the attack. One has but a poor vengeance
with women, Crosby; but at all events
she knows what I think of her. Of course
there is an end to all pretence of friendship
with her in the future, and I am glad of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope you didn’t say too much,’ says
Crosby, rather taken aback by the sullen
rage on the other’s brow.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How could I do that? If it had been a
man——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She might well congratulate herself that
she isn’t, if she could only see your eyes at
this moment,’ says Crosby, laughing in spite
of himself. ‘But she’ll make mischief out of
this, Paul, I’m afraid.’ He is silent a moment,
and then: ‘Your uncle is still bent, I suppose,
on your marriage with her daughter?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, rather a bore,’ says Wyndham,
frowning. ‘I don’t like to disappoint the
old man.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>‘You mean?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That I should not marry Josephine Prior
if my accession to a throne depended upon it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So bad as that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is what so bad as that?’—struck by a
meaning in the other’s tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, your infatuation for your tenant.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My——Oh, of course I might have
known you would come to look at it like that,’
says Wyndham, shrugging his shoulders.
With another man he might have been
offended. But it is hard to be offended with
Crosby. ‘Still, you are a sort of fellow one
might trust to take a broader view of things.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What broader do you want me to take?’
begins Crosby, slightly amused. ‘But to get
back to our argument—mine, rather. I think
it will be bad for you if you quarrel with
Shangarry over this matter. The title, of
course, must be yours—but barren honours
are hardly worth getting. And he may leave
his money away from you. You have told
me before this that he has immense sums in
his hands to dispose of—and much of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>property is not entailed. You should think,
Paul—you should think.’ He was the last
man in the world to think himself on such
an occasion as this.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have thought.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mean?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know what I mean,’ says Wyndham;
then, with sudden impatience: ‘Is
love necessary to marriage?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby laughs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is marriage necessary at all?’ says he.
‘Why not elect to do as I do, live and die
a jolly old bachelor?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! I don’t believe in you,’ says Paul,
with a rather mirthless smile. ‘If I went
in for that state of life, depending on you
as a companion, I should find myself left—sooner
or later.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, then,’ says Crosby, who has no
prejudices, ‘why not marry her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your tenant—this charming, unhappy,
pretty girl, who, believe me, Wyndham’—growing
suddenly grave—‘I regard as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>as you do with the very deepest respect.’
Crosby has his charm.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You go too far,’ says Wyndham, looking
a little agitated, however. ‘I am not in love
with her, as you seem to imagine.’ Crosby
smothers a smile, as in duty bound. ‘And,
besides, even if I did desire to marry her,
how could I do it? It would kill Shangarry
with his queer, old-fashioned ideas.... A
girl with no name.... And our name—so
old.... It would kill him, I tell you. And—and
besides all that, George, I don’t care for
her, and she doesn’t care for me&#160;... not in
that way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, you are the best judge of that,’
says Crosby. ‘And if it is as you say, I
am sorry you ever saw her. She has brought
you into a decidedly <em>risqué</em> situation. And
she is too good-looking to get out of it—or
you either, without scandal.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have seen her?’ Wyndham’s face is
full of rather angry inquiry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear fellow, don’t eat me! We
all saw her yesterday, if you come to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of it, in that tree of hers. You may remember
that ass Jones’s remarks about a
Hamadryad.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes, of course. And you thought——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To tell you the truth,’ says Crosby, ‘I
thought her the very image of—don’t hit
a little one, Wyndham! But I did think
her more like Mrs. Prior than even Mrs.
Prior’s own daughter is.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What absurd nonsense! And yet, now I
remember it, she—Ella—Miss Moore said she
felt as if she had seen Mrs. Prior before.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s odd. And yet not so odd as it
seems. Many families totally unrelated to
each other are often very much alike; I dare
say Mrs. Prior and Miss Moore’s mother,
though in different ranks of life, might have
possessed features of the same type, and
nature very similar, too. Same features,
same manners, you know, very often.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That ends the argument for me,’ says
Wyndham, with a frown; ‘Miss Moore’s
manners are as far removed from my aunt’s,
and as far above them, as is possible.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>He brushes rather hurriedly past his
friend. But his friend forgives him. He
stands, indeed, in the middle of the avenue,
staring after Wyndham’s vanishing form.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And to think he doesn’t know he is in
love with her!’ says he at last. ‘Any fellow
might know when he was in love with a
woman. Well,’—with a friendly sigh of
deep regret—‘I am afraid it will cost him

<p class='c010'>Autumn is dead. It has faded slowly and
tenderly away, with no great sudden changes,
no desperate looking back towards the life
departing, no morbid rushing towards the
death in front. Delicately, but very sorrowfully,
it went to its grave, and was buried
almost before one realized its loss.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now winter is with us; chill and
still chiller grow the winds, and harsh the
biting frosts.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It is as yet a young winter, just freshly
born, and full of the terrible vitality that
belongs to infancy. Sharp are the little
darting breezes, and merry blow the blinding
showers of snow, still so light and fragile,
laughed at by the children, and caught in
their little upturned hands, but still sure
forerunners of the bitter days to come, when
the baby winter shall be a man full grown,
and bad to wrestle with.</p>

<p class='c004'>To these days, so cold and pitiless to the
fragile creatures of the earth, little Bonnie
has succumbed. Into his aching limbs the
frosts have entered, racking the tender little
body, and bringing it to so low an ebb that
Susan, watching over him with miserable fear
and terrible forebodings from morning till
night, and from night again to morning
(she never now lets him out of her sight,
refusing even to let anyone else sleep with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>him), lives in secret, awful terror of what
every day may bring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cuddled into her young warm arms at
night, she clasps him tightly to her, feeling
he cannot be taken from her whilst thus she
holds him, whilst still she can feel him—feel
his little beloved form, now, alas! mere
bones, with their sad covering, that seems to
be of skin only. And to her Father in heaven
she prays, not only nightly, when he is in her
arms, but at intervals when she is on her
strong young feet, that he will spare her
this one awful grief—the death of her pretty
boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>No mother ever prayed harder, entreated
more wildly (yet always so silently), for the
life of her offspring than Susan prays for the
continuance of this small life.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the last week he has been very bad,
in great and incessant pain; and Susan,
abandoning all other duties, has given herself
up to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>No one has reprimanded her for this giving
up of her daily work, though the household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>is suffering much through lack of her many
customary ministrations. Even Miss Barry
has forgotten to scold, and goes very silently
about the house; whilst the Rector’s face
has taken a heart-broken expression—the
look it used to wear, as the elder children so
well remember, after their mother’s death.</p>

<p class='c004'>All day long Susan sits with her little boy,
sometimes, when his aches are worse than
usual, hushing him against her breast, and
breathing soft childish songs into his ear to
soothe his sufferings and keep up his heart,
whilst her own is breaking. For is it not
her fault that he is suffering now? If she had
not forgotten him—this little lamb of her
dead mother’s fold, left by that dying mother
to her special care—he might be now as well
and strong as all the rest of them.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>She is sitting with him now in the schoolroom,
lying back in the old armchair quite
motionless, for the suffering child within her
arms has fallen into a fitful slumber, when
the door is opened, and Crosby enters. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>had left the Park about a month ago, and
had not been expected back for some time—not
until the spring, indeed—but something
unknown or unacknowledged even by himself
had driven him back after four weeks to
this small corner of the earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sh!’ breathes Susan softly, putting up
her hand. A warm flush has suddenly dyed
her pale face, grown white through grief and
many watchings. Her surprise at seeing
Crosby is almost unbounded, and with it is
another feeling—of joy, of comfort, of support.
All through her strange joy and
surprise, however, she remembers the child,
and that he sleeps. Of late his slumbers
have grown very precious.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby advances slowly, carefully. This
gives him time to look at Susan, to mark the
sadness of the tender face bending over the
sleeping child, to mark also the terrible lines
of suffering on his. But his eyes wander
always back to Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>In her grief, how beautiful she is! how
human! how womanly! And with the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>pressed against her breast. Oh, Susan, you
were always pretty, but now! The grief is
almost divine. Oh, little young Madonna!</p>

<p class='c004'>But, then, to have Susan look like that!
He wakes from his dreams of her beauty with
a sharp anger against himself. And now
only one thing is uppermost in his mind—Susan
is suffering. Well, then, Susan must
not be allowed to suffer.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He is ill?’ he says quickly, in a low
tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, so ill! He—he has been ill now for
three weeks. The cold, that hurt him.’ She
lifts her face for a moment, struggles with
herself, and then lowers her head again, as if
to do something to Bonnie’s little necktie,
lest he should see her tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tell me about it,’ says Crosby, drawing
up a chair and seating himself close to her
and the boy. There is something so friendly,
so sympathetic, in his action that the poor
child’s heart expands.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you can’t think how bad it has been!’
she says. ‘This dreadful cold seems to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>into him. Speak very low. He slept hardly
two hours the whole of last night.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How do you know that?’—quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How should I not know?’—surprised. ‘I
slept with him. Who should know if I
didn’t?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then you did not even sleep two hours?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, what does it matter about me?’ says
she in a low, impatient tone. ‘Think of him.
All last night he cried—he cried dreadfully.
And what cut me to the heart,’ says the girl
in an agonized tone, ‘was that I think sometimes
he was keeping back his tears, for fear
they should grieve me. Oh, how he suffers!
Mr. Crosby’—suddenly, almost sharply—‘should
people, should little, lovely, darling
children like this, suffer so horribly, and
when it is no fault of their own? Oh’—passionately—‘it
is frightful! it is wrong!
Father is sometimes angry with me about
saying it, but how can God be so cruel?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Her tone vibrates with wild and angry
grief, yet still she keeps it low. It strikes
Crosby as wonderful that, through all her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>violent agitation, she never forgets the child
sleeping in her arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>He says nothing, however. Who could, to
comfort her, in an hour like this? He bends
over the sleeping child and looks at him.
Such a small face, and so lovely, in spite of
the furrows pain has laid upon it. How
clearly writ they are! And yet the child
is like Susan—strangely like. In the young
blooming face, bending over the emaciated
one, the likeness can be traced.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think—you think——’ whispers
Susan eagerly, following his gaze, and demanding
an answer to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He looks ill, but——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But?’ There is a terrible inquiry—oh,
more, poor child!—there is terrible entreaty
in her question.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says Crosby, ‘there is always
hope. But the child is very ill.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah!’ She shrinks from him. ‘That
there is no hope is what you want to say
to me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is not. Far worse cases have sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>recovered. But in the meantime’
anxiously—‘I think of you. You look
exhausted. You shouldn’t keep him on your
lap like that. I have just seen Miss Barry,
and she tells me you keep him in your arms
by night and by day.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan turns upon him with an almost fierce
light in her gentle eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall keep him in my arms always—always—when
he wishes it. I——’ She
stops. ‘He can’t die whilst I hold him,’
cries she. She draws in her breath sharply,
and then, as if the cruel word ‘die’ has
stung her, she breaks into silent, but most
bitter, weeping.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘This is killing you,’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I almost wish it were,’ says she. She
has choked back her tears, fearing lest the
sleeping child should be disturbed by the
heaving of her chest. She lifts her haggard,
sad young eyes to his. ‘It is I who have
brought him to this pass. Every pang of
his should by right be mine. It is I who
should bear them.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>‘It seems to me,’ says Crosby gravely, ‘that
you are bearing them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He waits a moment; but she has gone
back to her contemplation of her little
brother’s face. She is hanging over him, her
eyes fixed on the pale, fragile features, as if
fearing, as if dwelling, on the thought of the
last sad moment of all, when he will be no
longer with her, when the grave will have
closed over him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently Crosby, seeing her so absorbed,
rises very quietly and takes a step towards
the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he moves she lifts her head, and holds
out to him the one hand free.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby,’ whispers she, with a dreary
attempt at a smile, ‘I don’t believe I have
even said so much as “How d’ye do?” to
you. I certainly have not welcomed you
back——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Crosby, ‘not one word of
welcome. But how could I expect it at
such a time?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And, any way, I need not say it,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>she, her eyes filling. ‘You know you are
welcome.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To you, Susan?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To me? You know—you must know
that,’ says Susan, with the sweetest friendliness.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>Crosby goes straight into Mr. Barry’s
study, where he finds the Rector immersed
in his books and notes, and there makes clear
to him the subject that only five minutes ago
had become clear to himself. Yet it is so
cleverly described to Mr. Barry that the
latter might well be excused for believing
that it had been thought out for many days,
and carefully digested before being laid before
him. The fact was that he, Crosby, was
going to Germany almost immediately—certainly
next week—though even more
certainly he had not thought of going to
Germany—a country he detested—so late as
this morning. There were wonderful baths
there, he said, and a specialist for rheumatic
people. He made the specialist the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>part of the argument, though in reality it was
the greatest, as the professor he had in mind
(who had come to his mind during his interview
with Susan, so sadly miserable with
that child upon her knee) was one of the
most distinguished men alive where rheumatic
affections were in question. If Mr.
Barry would trust his little son to him, would
let him take Bonnie to these wonderful life-restoring
baths and to this even more
wonderful specialist, he would regard it as
a great privilege, as a mark of friendship,
of esteem.</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor Mr. Barry! He sank back in his
chair, and covered his eyes with his hands.
How could he take from a perfect—well, a
comparative stranger—so great a boon? All
the old instincts, the pride of a good race,
fought with him; but with the old instincts
and the pride love fought, and gained the
victory.</p>

<p class='c004'>The child—had he the right to refuse life
to the child because of his senseless shrinking
from obligations to another? He asked himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>this question over and over again, whilst
Crosby, who sincerely pitied him because he
understood him, waited. And then all at
once the father saw the child bathed in
sweat and moaning with awful pain, and
human nature prevailed. He gave in.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>‘I can never repay you, Mr. Crosby,’ he
said, in a shortened tone, standing tall and
grim and crushed behind his table, his sharp
aristocratic features intensified by the shabbiness
of the furniture around him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is nothing to repay,’ says Crosby
lightly. ‘This is a whim of mine. I believe
in this specialist of whom I tell you; many
do not. But I have sufficient cause for my
belief to ask you to entrust your little son to
my care. I tell you honestly it is a whim.
If you will gratify it, it will give me
pleasure.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barry rises and walks to the window.
His gaunt figure stands out clear before it
and the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no,’ says he. ‘You cannot put it like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that. Do not imagine all your kind words
can destroy the real meaning of your kind
action. This is the best action, sir, that I
have ever known’—his voice shakes—‘and,
as I tell you, I can never repay it.... But
the child——’</p>

<p class='c004'>He turns more sharply, as if going to the
window merely to adjust the blind, but a
slight glance at him has told Crosby that the
tears are running down his cheeks. Poor
man! Poor father!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The child will be safe with me,’ says
Crosby earnestly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know that.’ The Rector turns all at
once; his face is now composed, but he looks
older, thinner, if that could be. He comes
straight up to Crosby. ‘I am a dull old
man,’ says he hurriedly. ‘I can’t explain
myself. But I know what you are doing—I
know—I——’ He hesitates. ‘I would pray
for you, but you have no need of prayers.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We all have need of prayers,’ says Crosby
gravely. ‘Mr. Barry, this is an adventure
of mine, out of which no man can say how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>I may come. I take your child from you,
but how can I say that I will bring him back
to you? If you will pray, pray for him, and
for me, too, that we may come back together.’</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Tears from the depth of some divine despair.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus it was arranged, and when another
week has come and gone, the day arrives
when Crosby is to carry off little Bonnie to
distant lands with a view to his recovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan had of course been told, and there
had been a rather painful scene between her
and her aunt and her father.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Bonnie to be taken from her!’ and so
soon.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But for his good, Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She had given in at the last, as was inevitable,
with many cruel tearings at her
heart, and miserable beliefs that his going
now would mean his going for ever. He
would never come back. And they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>bury him there in that strange land without
his Susan to comfort him and soothe his
dying moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is with great fainting of the spirit that
Susan rises to-day—to-day, that will see her
little lad carried away from her, no matter in
whose kindly hands, to where she cannot
know under three days’ post whether he
be alive or——</p>

<p class='c004'>At one part of his dressing (he has never
yet since his first illness been dressed by
anyone but Susan) she had given way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course, the child knew he was going
somewhere with Mr. Crosby—he liked Crosby—‘to
be made well and strong, my own
ducky,’ as Susan had told him, with her
heart bursting.</p>

<p class='c004'>But I think it was when she was halfway
through his dressing, and, kneeling on the
floor beside him, was fastening his small
suspenders, that Susan’s courage failed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Bonnie! Oh, my own Bonnie!’ she cried,
pressing her head against his thin little ribs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ said the child earnestly, turning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and clasping his arms round her bent head,
‘I’ll come back to you. I will indeed! I
promise!’</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a solemn promise; but it gave
Susan nothing but such an awful pang of
sure foreboding that it subdued her. Despair
gives strength. She stopped her tears, and
rose, and ministered to his little needs, and
became as though grief was no longer hers—as
though she lived and moved as her usual
self. This immobility frightened her, because
she knew she would pay the penalty for it
later on, when he was gone.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>Now, standing in the garden, awaiting
Mr. Crosby and the carriage that is to carry
the boy away from her for six long months,
she is still dry-eyed and calm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here it comes. She can hear the horses’
hoofs now, and the roll of the carriage-wheels
along the road. And now it is stopping
at the gate. And now——</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Crosby has jumped out and is coming
towards her.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>‘You must say good-bye to me here,
Susan,’ says he, ‘because there will only be
good-bye for the little brother presently.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Obedient child.’ But as he holds her
hand and looks at her, he can see the rings
that grief has made around her beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seeing him still waiting, as if for a
larger answer, as she thinks, though in
reality he is only silent because of his studying
of her sad sweet face with its tears and
its courage, so terrible in one so young, she
says tremulously, ‘I have not even thanked
you!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is not it,’ says Crosby. ‘There is
nothing to thank me for, but there is something,
Susan, you might say. Tell me that
you will miss me a little bit whilst I’m
away.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s hand trembles within his, but
answer makes she none.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’ says he again, as if determined
not to be defrauded of his rights by this child—this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>pretty child. She may not love him,
but surely she may miss him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan raises her eyes, and he can see that
they are filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I shall!’ says she earnestly. ‘I shall
miss you, and long for your return.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This fervid speech is so unlike Susan, that
all at once he arranges a meaning for it. Of
course, Bonnie will be with him; she will
long for the child’s return. If he resents
a little this thought of Susan’s for Bonnie, to
the entire exclusion of himself, he still admires
the affection that has inspired it and that
desolates her lovely face.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, I shall take care of him,’ says he
earnestly. ‘Trust me in this matter. If
human skill can do anything for him, I shall
see that it is done; if care and watching and
attention are of any use, he shall have them
from me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, but love?’ says Susan. ‘He has been
so used to love! And now he will not have
me. Mr. Crosby’—clasping her hands together
as if to keep the trembling of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>from him—‘try—try to love him! He is so
sweet, so dear, that it can’t be hard—and—and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She stops; her face is as white as death.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I would to God, Susan,’ says he, ‘that
you could have come with us too; but that—that
was impossible.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know—I know. And, of course, I
sound very ungrateful; but he is so ill, so
fragile, so near to——’ She shivers, as if
some horrid pain had touched her. ‘And it
is to me he has turned for everything up to
this. And to-morrow’—suddenly she lifts
her hands to her face, and breaks down
altogether—‘oh, who will dress him to-morrow?’</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>The end has almost come. Bonnie has
said good-bye to his father and all the rest of
them, and is now clinging to Susan and
crying bitterly. Poor Susan! she is very
pale, and is visibly trembling as she holds
the child to her with all her strength, as
though to let him go is almost impossible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>her; but she holds back her tears bravely,
afraid of distressing him further.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I told you I should have taken you with
us,’ says Crosby in a low tone to Susan, more
with a view to lightening the situation than
anything else. But the situation is made of
material too heavy to be blown aside by any
such light wind. Susan pays no heed to
him. He is quite aware, indeed, after a
moment, that Susan neither sees nor hears
him. She is holding the child against her
heart, and breathing into his ear broken
words of love and hope and courage.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the final moment comes. Crosby
has shaken hands with Mr. Barry, who is
looking paler and more gaunt than usual, for
at least the fourth time, and has now come to
the carriage in which Susan has placed
Bonnie, having wrapped him warmly round
with rugs. Betty is standing near her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye,’ says Crosby, holding out his
hand to Betty, who is crying softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, good-bye,’ cries she, flinging her arms
round his neck and giving him a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>hug. ‘We shall never forget this of you—never!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall bring him back,’ says he, smiling.
He pats her shoulder—dear little girl!—and
turns to Susan. ‘Don’t be unhappy,’ he
whispers hurriedly. ‘You spoke of love for
him. I shall love him! I shall never let him
out of my sight, Susan. I swear that to you.
You believe me? You will take comfort?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I believe you,’ says Susan, lifting her
miserable eyes to his, ‘and I trust you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye, then.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye. I heard what you said to
Betty. You will bring him back—that is a
promise.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘With the help of God I’ll bring him back
to you,’ says Crosby solemnly. ‘And now,
good-bye again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye,’ says Susan. And then, to his
everlasting surprise, she leans forward, lays
her hands upon his shoulders, and presses
her lips to his cheek, not lightly or carelessly,
but with heartfelt feeling. She shows no
confusion. Not so much as a blush appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>upon her face. It seems the most natural
thing in the world—to her!</p>

<p class='c004'>That it is gratitude only that has impelled
her to this deed is quite plain to Crosby.
He pushes her back from him very gently,
and, stepping into the carriage, is soon out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the memory of that kiss goes with
him. It seems to linger on his cheek, and
he can still see her as she raised her head,
with her lovely tear-dimmed eyes on his. It
was all done in the most innocent, the most
friendly way. She had no thought beyond
the fact that he was being very good to the
little idolized brother. It was thus she
showed her gratitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>But even through gratitude to kiss him!
Suddenly a fresh, a most unpleasant thought
springs to life. No doubt she regards him
as an old fogey—a man of such and such an
age—a kind of bachelor uncle! Oh, confound
it! He is not so very much older than
she is, if one comes to think of it. He feels
a rush of anger towards Susan, followed by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>strange depression, that he either will not or
does not understand. The anger, however,
he understands well enough. There is no
earthly reason why she should think him old
enough to kiss like that. It was abominable
of her.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is conscious of a longing to go back
and have it out with her—to ask her at what
age she considers a man may be kissed. But
at this point he checks himself, and gives
way to a touch of mirth that is a trifle grim.
She might mistake his meaning, and say
twenty—that would be about her own age.</p>

<p class='c004'>And of course it is impossible to go back,
the journey once begun. Though why he
had undertaken the charge of this child except
to please her he hardly knows. And in
all probability the cure will never be effected.
And then she will go even further, and regret
having given him that insulting kiss—of
gratitude. And what on earth is he to do
with this child—this burden?</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he looks round at the little burden.
Bonnie is asleep. All the tears and excitement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>have overcome him, and he is lying
back in a deep slumber, and in a most uncomfortable
position.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby bends over him, and tenderly, very
tenderly, lifts the small delicate, flower-like
head from its uneasy resting-place against
the side of the carriage, and lays it softly on
his arm. And thus he supports it for the
rest of the drive, until, Dublin being reached,
he gives him into the care of a trained nurse
procured from the Rotunda, who is to accompany
the child abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, what a Christmas Day!’ cries Betty,
springing out of bed and rushing to the
window.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will catch your death of cold,’ says
Susan sleepily; but in spite of this protest,
or, rather, in despite of it, she, too, jumps
out of her cosy nest and hurries to the
window. ‘Oh, what a morning!’ breathes
she.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, the world seems all afire to-day.
The sun is glittering upon the snow,
and the snow is casting back at it lights
scarcely less brilliant. All the trees and
shrubs are gaily decked with snowy wraps
and armlets, whilst here and there, through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the universal white, big branches of holly-berries,
scarlet as blood, peep out.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ouf! Yes; but it’s cold,’ says Betty,
after a moment or two.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I told you you would catch cold,’ says
Susan, turning upon her indignantly, though
in reality she stands quite as big a chance of
meeting the dread foe as Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll catch you instead!’ cries Betty, with
full intent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whereon ensues a combat that might have
given the gods pause—a most spirited hunt,
that takes them round and round the small
bedroom a dozen times or more. It is a
regular chase; over the bed, and past the
wardrobe, and behind the dressing-table—it
was a near shave for Susan that last, and
full of complication, but she gets out of it
with the loss of only one small china ornament,
the very least concession that could be
made to the god of battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now away again! Over the bed once
more, and round a chair, deftly directed at
the enemy’s toes, and——After all, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>very bravest of us can sometimes know defeat,
and Susan is at last run to earth between
a basket-chair and a trunk.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>After this they condescend to dress—both
a little exhausted, and Betty, I regret to say,
jibbing at her bath.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If it was hot I’d say nothing,’ says she.
‘When I’m married I’ll have a hot bath in
December.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who’d marry you?’ says Susan, and then,
like the immortal parrot, is sorry that she
spoke. Showers of icy water descend upon
her!</p>

<p class='c004'>But now breakfast is ready, and they must
hasten down, with a last look out of their
favourite window at the golden colouring
there.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose it’s almost warm where Bonnie
is,’ says Betty, after a slight pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope so. Yes; I think so.’ There is,
however, doubt in Susan’s tone. It seems
impossible to believe any place warm with
that snow-burdened garden outside.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>‘It must be warm,’ says Betty. ‘Bonnie
could not stand cold like this, and the last
accounts were not bad’—this rather doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No. But’—Susan’s face, that had been
glowing, now loses something of its warmth—‘not
good, either. Still——Betty’—she
looks at her sister—‘don’t you think
Mr. Crosby is a man one might depend
upon?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I do—I do indeed!’ says Betty.
‘He’—earnestly, and with a view to please
Susan—‘is so ugly that anyone might depend
upon him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ugly! He certainly is not ugly,’ says
Susan. ‘I must say, Betty, I think sometimes
you make the most foolish remarks.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I’ll say he’s handsome, if you like,’
says Betty, slightly affronted. ‘Any way, he
has been very good to Bonnie. I suppose
that’s what makes him handsome in your
eyes. And he has been kind, too—could
anyone be kinder?—and sometimes, Susan, I
feel that I love him just as much as you do.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>‘Oh, I don’t love him!’ says Susan, flushing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No? Is it gratitude, then? Well, whatever
it is you feel, Susan, I feel just the same—because
he has been so kind to poor Bonnie.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan turns away without replying. And
then, ‘We must go down,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, come,’ says Betty, a little urgently.
‘I’m sure I have only been waiting for you,
Susan. I wonder what Christmas cards we
shall get.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘One from Dom, any way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Fitzgerald had been summoned home
by his guardian for Christmas, much to his
disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that! But Dom doesn’t count!’ says
Betty, tilting her pretty nose in rather a disdainful
fashion.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>Breakfast is nearly over, however, before
the post arrives. The postman of Curraghcloyne
has had many delays to-day. At
every house every resident has given him his
Christmas-box, and sometimes a ‘stirrup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>cup’ besides, so that by the time he gets to
the Rectory he is very considerably the worse
for wear. Yet he gives out his letters there
with the air of a finished postman, and accepts
the Rectory annual five shillings with
a bow that would not have disgraced Chesterfield.
That his old caubeen is on the side
of his head, and his articulation somewhat
indistinct, detracts in no wise from the dignity
of the way in which he delivers his
packages and bids Mr. Barry ‘All th’ complaints
o’ t’ saison!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, here’s one from Dom!’ cries Betty,
tearing open her letter. ‘And written all on
the back! What on earth has he got to say
on a Christmas card? Why didn’t he write
a letter?</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘“<span class='sc'>My dear Betty</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>‘“I feel as I write this that you don’t
know where you are. That shows the great
moral difference between you and me. I
know where I am, and I wish to Heaven I
didn’t. Old uncle is awfully trying. Puts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>your back up half a dozen times a minute. I
don’t believe I’ll ever get back; because if he
doesn’t murder me I shall infallibly murder
him, and then where shall we all be? I’ve
written most religiously all over this card (I
chose a big one on purpose), so that you
cannot, in the usual mean fashion peculiar to
girls, send it on again to your dearest friend
as a New Year’s offering. See how well I
know your little ways!”’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Isn’t he a beast!’ says Betty, with honest
meaning. ‘And it would have done so nicely
for old Miss Blake. You see, she has sent
me one, though I had quite forgotten all
about her. I must say Dom is downright
malignant. I suppose I’ll have to buy her
one now. All the rest of mine have “Happy
Christmas” on them, and it does look badly
to send a card like that for New Year’s Day.
Dom’s has both Christmas and New Year
on it, and of course it would have suited
beautifully. Oh, Susan’—pouncing on a card
in Susan’s hand—‘what a beauty, and nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>written on the back. You will let me have
it for Miss Blake, won’t you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no,’ says Susan hastily. She takes
it back quickly from Betty. A little sharp
unwelcome blush has sprung into her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who is it from—James?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘James! Are you mad?’ says Susan.
‘Fancy my caring for a card from James!
Why, here is his, and you can have it to
make ducks and drakes of, if you like.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But that, then?’ questions Betty, with
some pardonable curiosity, pointing at the
card denied her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is from Mr. Crosby. Don’t you think,
Betty,’ the treacherous colour growing deeper,
‘that one should treasure even a card sent
by one who has been so good to Bonnie?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do—I do indeed,’ says Betty earnestly.
‘And, after all, one would treasure a card
from most people. Even this’—flicking Dom’s
somewhat contemptuously—‘I’ll have to treasure,
as I can’t send it away to anyone.
Susan, I wonder if Ella has got any cards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>besides those we sent her? Shall we go to
her this afternoon and ask her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t suppose she can have got any,’
says Susan thoughtfully. ‘You know she
keeps herself so aloof from the world. She
had yours and mine certainly, and Carew’s.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did Carew send her one?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Didn’t you know?’ Susan laughs a little.
‘I didn’t think it was a secret. I went into
his room yesterday, and saw an envelope
directed to Ella, and said something about it;
but I really quite thought he had told you,
too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, he didn’t! After dinner, Susan,
let us run down and see her, and show her
our cards.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no!’ says Susan, shrinking a little.
‘If she had none of her own, it might make
her feel—feel lonely!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s true,’ says Betty.</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Who would trust slippery chance?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But, after all, Ella has a card of her own,
that is not from Susan, or Betty, or Carew.
Some hours ago the post brought it to her,
and she has gone out into the garden, that is
now lovely in its white garments, with the
red berries of the holly-trees peeping through
the snow, to read it and look at it again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The walks have been swept clear by Denis,
who has come down from Dublin to spend a
long (a very long) and happy Christmas week
with his wife. A third person in Mrs. Denis’s
kitchen and private apartments might have
questioned about the happiness, but that it is
a lively week goes beyond all doubt.</p>

<p class='c004'>With Ella’s card a little line had come too.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Mr. Wyndham was coming down by the
afternoon train, to see to something for Crosby,
who had written to him from Carlsbad, and
he hoped to call at the Cottage before his
return. Ella reads and re-reads the little
note. The afternoon train comes in at one
o’clock. It is now after twelve. Soon he
will be here! How kind he is to her! How
good! And to remember that Christmas
card! She had heard Susan and Betty talking
of Christmas cards, and they had sent
her one, each of them, and Carew had sent
one, too. They also were kind, so kind; but
that Mr. Wyndham should remember her,
with all his other friends to think of!</p>

<p class='c004'>Alone in this dear garden, with no one to
hear or see her, she gives way to her mood.
Miss Manning has gone up to Dublin to spend
her Christmas Day with an old friend, urged
thereto by Ella, who, indeed, wished to be
alone after her post had come. Now she
can walk about here, and speak to her own
heart without interruption, Mrs. Denis being
engaged in that intellectual game called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>‘words’ with her husband. Oh, how happy
she feels—how extraordinarily happy! She
laughs aloud, and, lifting her arms, crosses
them with lazy delight behind her head, and
amongst the warm furs that encircle her
neck. This action draws her head backwards—her
eyes upwards——</p>

<p class='c004'>Upwards! To the top of the wall on that
far distant corner. There her eyes rest as
if transfixed, and then grow frozen in this
awful horror that has come to her. Where
is the happiness now in the eyes—the young,
glad joy?</p>

<p class='c004'>She stands as if stricken into stone, staring
into a face that is staring back at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the wall close to the old tree, from
which she loves to look into the Rectory
garden and wave a handkerchief to the
children there to come to her, sits Moore,
the man from whom she had fled; the man
whom she dreads most of all things upon
earth; the man who wanted to marry
her!</p>

<p class='c004'>Oh dear, dear Heaven, is all her good time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>ended? Such a little, little time, too—such
a transient gleam of light—and all so black
behind it! Like a flash her life spreads itself
out before her. What a childhood!
Unmothered, unloved! What a cold, terrible
girlhood! and then a few short months of
quiet rest and calm, and now again the old,
hideous misery.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems impossible for her to remove her
eyes from those above her—to move in any
way. Her brain grows at last confused, and
only three words seem to be clear—to din
themselves with a cruel persistency in her
ears: ‘All is over! All is over!’</p>

<p class='c004'>They have neither sense nor meaning to
her in her present state, but still they go on
repeating themselves: ‘All is over! All, all,
all is over!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The man has caught a branch of the tree
now, and with a certain activity, considering
the squareness and the bulk of his body,
has swung himself into it, and so on to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is coming towards her. The girl still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>stands immovable, as if rooted to the gravel
walk; but her mind has returned to her.
Alas! it brings no hope with it. This man,
who has been a terror to her from her childhood,
has now again come into the circle of
her daily life. She draws back as he approaches
her—her first movement since her
frightened eyes met his—and holds up her
hands, as a child might, to ward off mischief.
This coming face to face with him is a horrible
shock as well as an awakening. She had
believed herself mistress of her fears of him,
though her horror might still obtain, and
now, now she knows that both her horror
and her fear are still rampant.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I’ve found you at last,’ says the
man, advancing across the grass. ‘And
here!’ There is something terrible in his
tone and in the look of scorn he casts at
the pretty surroundings, beautiful always,
though now wrapped in their snowy shrouds.
‘Four months ago I was here,’ says he, after
a lengthened pause. ‘I was on your track
then, but a mere chance put me off it. Four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>months ago I might have dragged you out of
this sink of iniquity—had I but known!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella is silent. That day when she had
run back from the Rectory and fancied she
saw him turn the corner of the road. That
fancy had been no delusion, then! Ah! why
had she played with it?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Have you nothing to say?’ asks he
slowly, sullenly, gazing at her with hard,
compelling eyes. ‘No excuse to make, or
are you trying to get up a story? I tell
you, girl, it will be useless. This speaks for
itself.’ Again he looks round him, at the
charming cottage, the tall trees, the dainty
garden and winding walks.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no story,’ says Ella at last. Her
voice is dry and husky; she can hardly force
the words between her lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You lie!’ says the man fiercely. ‘There
is a story, and a most —— one for you.’
His eyes light with a sudden fury, and he
looks for a moment as though he would
willingly fall upon her and choke the life
out of her slender body. His manner is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>distinctly brutal, but yet there is something
about it that speaks of honesty. It is rough,
cruel, hateful, but honest for all that. A
certain belief in himself is uppermost.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is a tall man, very strong in build, and
with strong features too. His dress is that
of the comfortable, half-educated artisan;
but he shows some neatness in his attire.
His shirt is immaculate, his hair well cut,
and altogether he might suggest to the unimpassioned
observer that he was a man who
had dreamt many dreams of rising above the
life to which he had been born. He is, at
all events, not an ordinary man of any type,
and distinctly one to be feared, if only for
the enormous strength he had put forth to
fight with his daily surroundings, and with
his past (a more difficult enemy still), so as
to gain a footing on the ladder that will raise
him above his fellows.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl shrinks from him, frightened even
more by the wild light in his eyes than by
his words, and as she shrinks he advances,
contempt mingled with menace in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>‘You thought I should never find you,’
says he, with cruel slowness. ‘But mine
you were from the beginning, and mine you
are still.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella makes a faint and trembling protest.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Deny it!’ cries he. ‘Deny it if you can!
Your own mother left you to me—a mother
who was ashamed to tell her real name. She
left you—a waif, a stray—to my charity, and
so, of my charity, I bought you through my
wife. You are mine, I tell you. Hah! well
you may hide your face! Child of infamy,
now sunk in infamy!’</p>

<p class='c004'>His strong, horrible face is working. The
girl, as if petrified by fear, has fallen back into
a garden-chair, and is sitting there cowering,
her face hidden in her shaking hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So,’ continues the man in mocking accents,
the very mockery of it betraying the intolerable
love he had borne her in her sad past—a
love now deadened, but still half alive, and
quick with revengeful wrath, ‘you ran away
from me, not so much from hatred of me,
but for love of him.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>‘Of him?’ Ella lifts her haggard face
at this.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ay, girl, of him! The man who has
dragged you down to this—who has brought
you here to be a bird in his gilded cage.
D’ye think to blind me still? I’ve followed
you, I tell you, step by step. You didn’t
reckon on my staying powers, perhaps. But
I had sworn by the heaven above me’—lifting
his hand, large and rough and powerful,
to the sky—‘that I would have you, dead
or alive!’ He pauses. ‘When you left me,
I thought at first that I had been too harsh
to you. But I was wrong: such as you
require harshness.’ Again he grows silent.
‘You ran to him, then, because you loved
him! Such as you love easily; has it
occurred to you, however, to ask yourself
how long he will love you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—someone must have been telling you
strange things. All this is impossible,’ says
the girl, pressing her hands against her
beating heart. ‘No one loves me—no
one.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>‘And you do not love anyone? Answer
that,’ says Moore.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No. No—except——’ She hesitates
miserably. She had thought of Susan—she
had meant to declare her love for Susan as
her sole love, but another form had suddenly
risen between her and Susan, and she loses
herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Another lie,’ says Moore, with a sneer.
‘Lies become fine ladies, and you seem to
be making yourself into one in a hurry.
But you’ll find yerself out there’—with all
his care he sometimes drops into his earlier
form of speech, and that ‘yerself’ betrays
him. ‘You’re not built for a fine lady.
You—you’—furiously—‘who came out of
the gutter! Yet I can see you have been
doing the fine lady very considerably of late—so
considerably that you can now lie like
the best of them. But’—with a touch of
absolute ferocity—‘I tell you, your lies will
be of little use to you with me. I’ve dropped
on the truth of your story, and there shall
be an end of it. To my dead wife your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>dead mother left you, and from my dead
wife you have come to me again. To me
you belong; I am your guardian; you are
bound by law to follow me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella makes a terrified gesture, then sinks
back upon her seat, pale and chilled to her
heart’s core.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To follow you?’ The words come from
between her lips, whispered rather than
uttered; but he hears them.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ay, to follow me. You shall not stay in
this home of infamy another hour if I can
prevent it. And prevent it I shall.’</p>

<p class='c004'>His rugged, disagreeable face, so full of
strength, lights up as he speaks these words
of command.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I cannot go,’ says the girl faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>She puts out her hands again with that
old, childish movement as if to ward off
something hateful to her. There is so much
aversion in this act that Moore’s temper fails
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hate me as much as you will, still, come
with me you shall!’ says he. ‘Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>imagine——’ Here he takes a step towards
her, and, catching her by the wrist, swings
her to and fro with distinct brutality, then
lets her go. ‘Do you think, having once
found you, I shall let you go? No; though’—he
makes a pause, and, standing before her,
pours his words into her unwilling, nay, but
half-understanding, ears—‘though I so despise
you that I would now consider my
name dishonoured if joined with yours—even
now when I know you not to be worth the
picking up—still, I will not let you go. You
are mine, and with me you shall leave this
old country and seek another. I start for
Australia to-morrow week, and you shall
start with me. Together we shall seek
that land.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I cannot go,’ repeats Ella feebly. She
looks magnetized. The old terror is full
upon her, and it is but a dying effort to
resist him that she now makes. ‘I—I——’
She stops again, and then bursts out: ‘It
would kill me! Oh!’—holding out her hands
wildly—‘why do you want me to go away?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Why do you want me to leave this place?
How’—miserably—‘can I be of any help to
you? Of any use? You know’—in softest,
most piteous accents—‘that I hate you—why,
then, take me with you? Why not
let me stay here in peace?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In sin you mean,’ says Moore, his harsh
voice now filled with a new virulence. ‘Make
an end of this, girl—for come with me you
shall. What’—violently—‘you would not
live with me, who would have honourably
married you; but you would live with him,
who will never marry you!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do not desire that he should marry me,’
says the girl, drawing herself up. Even in
this terrible moment, when all her senses
feel dulled, a look of pride grows upon her
beautiful face. ‘And he does not live here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Enough of that!’—gruffly. ‘You have
told lies sufficient for one morning. Get up,
and come with me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Come with you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ay—and at once!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But’—she has risen, as if in strange unreasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>obedience to his command, being
fully beneath the spell born of her horror
and fear of him—‘but—I must have time—to
write—to leave a word. He has been so
kind—so kind. Give me’—her face is deadly
white now, her tone anguished—‘only one
moment to go in and write a line of good-bye
to him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not one!’ says Moore sternly. ‘I shall
not even wait for you to take off those
garments—the garments of sin—that you
are wearing. You shall come as you are—and
now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He lays his hand upon her arm, and draws
her towards the gate; still, as in a dream,
she follows him. The bitterness of death is
on her, yet she goes with him calmly—quietly.
Perhaps there is a hope in her
heart that as she had run away from him
once, she might be able to do so again. But
could she? Would he not, having been
warned by her first escape, take pains to
guard against a second? She knows that
in her dreams, when he is not here, she can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>defy him, elude him, but to defy him when
he is present would be too much for her;
and, besides, he is her lawful guardian; he
has said so. Her own mother had left her
to him. He might call in the policeman in
the village, and so compel her in that way.
But oh, to go without saying good-bye to
Mr. Wyndham!</p>

<p class='c004'>He had said he would come to-day! But
all hope of his coming now is at an end.
And Mrs. Denis! Not even to see her—she
might have helped her. And not to say
one word to her, or to Susan! What—what
will they all think of her?</p>

<p class='c004'>At this moment they come to the hall-door
of the Cottage, and she stops suddenly, and
makes a little rush towards it, but the clutch
on her arm is strong.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To say one word to Mrs. Denis,’ she
gasps imploringly, damp breaking out upon
her young forehead. ‘Oh!’—beating her
hands with miserable agony upon her chest—‘think
how it will be! They will for ever
and ever remember me as ungrateful—unloving—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>creature who had taken their love,
and abused it. They will be glad to forget
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope so,’ says he coldly, utterly unmoved—nay,
knowing even pleasure in her
grief. ‘The sooner they forget you, and you
them, the better. “They!”’ He repeats the
word. ‘Why don’t you say “he” and be
done with it?’ cries he furiously. ‘What
a —— hypocrite you are!’</p>

<p class='c004'>He almost drags her to the gate. Ella,
half fainting, finds herself at it. It is the
last step. In here lies safety and happiness
and peace—out there—— Moore turns the
key in the lock, and pulls at the handle of
the door. Yes, it is all over. The door
opens. At this instant a long, low, passionate
cry escapes from Ella.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham is standing in the roadway just
outside the gate!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘Narrow minds think nothing right that is above
their own capacity.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What is the meaning of this?’ says Wyndham.
He comes in quickly, locking the door
and putting the key in his pocket. He has
taken in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It means that I have come here to take
this girl out of your hands,’ says Moore,
who shows no fear, or anything else, save
a concentrated hatred of the man before
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then you have come on an idle errand,’
says Wyndham haughtily. ‘I should advise
you to amuse yourself on Christmas Days,
in future, with something more likely to
prove amusing. This young lady’—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>strong emphasis—‘does not stir from this
spot except at her own desire.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is coming, for all that,’ says Moore
doggedly. Wyndham glances from him to
Ella, who now, white as a sheet, is standing
trembling, like a frightened creature, with
one small hand uplifted to her lips, as if to
hide their trembling. Her eyes are agonized,
but in some way Wyndham can see that,
though she fancies hope dead, still hope in
him has lit one small spark.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you going?’ says Wyndham, addressing
her directly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no,’ breathes she from between her
frozen lips. She takes a step forward.
‘Don’t let me go,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly I shan’t let you go,’ says
Wyndham, with the utmost cheerfulness.
‘As a fact, indeed, I forbid you to go. I
have excellent authority for looking after
you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What authority?’ asks Moore, who has
now struck a most aggressive attitude upon
the gravel path. ‘I shall question that.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>You to talk of authority! Why, I tell you
that you, and such as you, cut a very bad
figure in a court of law.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never mind that, my man,’ says Wyndham.
‘I have no time now for impromptu
speeches. May I ask what claim you have
on this young lady?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am her rightful guardian,’ says Moore,
‘and I shall exercise my rights. Open that
gate, or it will be the worse for you. You
talk of claims! What claim have you? Is
she your wife or your——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham, who is now as white as Ella
herself, turns to her:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Go away,’ says he quickly; ‘go at
once.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hah! you don’t like her to hear it,’ cries
Moore, now in a frenzy, as Ella, only too
glad to get back into the beloved house, runs
quickly towards the Cottage. He would
have intercepted her flight, but Wyndham
prevents him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But if not your wife, what is she? Your
mistress?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>‘Hold your tongue, you —— scoundrel,’
says Wyndham, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hold yours,’ says Moore. ‘Is she your
wife? Come, answer that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Wyndham. ‘But——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No “buts” for me,’ says Moore. ‘I know
the meaning of your “but.” Come, who’s
the —— scoundrel now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You, beyond all doubt,’ says Wyndham.
‘Stand back, man’—as the other makes a
lunge towards him—‘and listen to law, if
not to reason. You have as much claim on
her as the beggar in the street beyond, and
you know it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do not.’ Moore shows an air of open
defiance. ‘Her mother died in my wife’s
house, and my wife died later on and left
her to me. That makes me her guardian,
I reckon. As for you’—turning upon Wyndham
defiantly—‘I wonder you can look an
honest man in the face after what you’ve
done to her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can look an honester man than you in
the face,’ says Wyndham quietly. ‘But let’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>come to business. You wanted to marry her—eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She told you that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly she told me that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She told you most things, it seems to me’—with
a sneer that is full of trouble and
jealousy. ‘Aren’t you ashamed to repeat
them—to me?’ He pauses, and his face
grows positively livid. ‘To me, who would
have married her fair and square, whilst you—what
have you done?’ He steps forward,
and makes as though he would clutch at
Wyndham’s collar, but the latter flings him
backward.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, what have I done?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ruined her, body and soul.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are wrong there,’ says Wyndham,
who has recovered from his sudden temper,
and is now quite calm. ‘You had better sit
down and let us talk it over. You are wrong
on all counts. I have done her no injury.
You are not her proper guardian. She is in
a position to support herself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is not,’ says Moore coarsely.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>‘But she is, I assure you, if’—with
elaborate politeness—‘you will permit me
to explain. Miss—what is her name, by
the way, Moore?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’—with a scowl—‘is for you to find
out.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True. Well, I shall find it out. In the
meantime, I suppose you quite recognise
the fact that all is at an end about that
idea of yours that you have any power over
her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It would take a good lawyer to convince
me of that,’ says Moore insolently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A good lawyer,’ says Wyndham. ‘Well,
name one.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Paul Wyndham, for one.’ Moore laughs
sardonically as he says it, and looks at his
antagonist as if defying him to question the
power of the man he has named.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham smiles. After all, what a compliment
this man has paid him! He dips his
hand into his waistcoat-pocket, and brings
out a leather card-case, and hands it to
Moore. The latter opens it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>There is a slight pause, then Moore gives
him back the case in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So you are Paul Wyndham?’ says he.
His face has changed colour, but still his
bull-dog courage sticks to him. ‘Then you
ought to be the more ashamed of yourself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I expect I’ll make you very much ashamed
of yourself,’ says Wyndham, ‘and that almost
immediately. An abduction has a very
unpleasant sound nowadays, and generally
means trouble to the principal actor in it.
I’d advise you to sit down and let us talk
sense. I know all your dealings with this—this
young lady, and they scarcely redound
to your credit. In fact, I am pretty sure
they would lead you into mischief—and six
months’ hard labour—if eloquently stated.
That is the very least you would get—unless——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Six months! I am going abroad on
Thursday next.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you? I wouldn’t be too sure, if I
were you,’ says Wyndham grimly. ‘It’s as
bad a case of persecution as I have ever gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>into. And I may as well say at once that, if
you persist in your determination to carry
off this poor child against her will, I shall
call in the village police and expose the
whole matter.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Moore, who has been cowed by Wyndham’s
name and the stern air of the barrister, in
spite of his show of defiance, falters here,
and the result of the long conversation that
ensues between the two men leaves all in
Wyndham’s hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the end, seeing the game was up,
Moore gave in unconditionally. He acknowledged
that Ella’s name was not Moore.
It was Haynes. She was no relation of his
or his wife’s, but undoubtedly her mother
had left the girl to their charge when dying,
and as she was useful and his wife was fond
of her, they kept her with them. Her father
was dead. Mrs. Haynes had always been
very reticent. He was of opinion that she
had once been in better circumstances.
Haynes was not respectable—he, Moore,
had an idea that his father had cast him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>off. He was not at all sure that Haynes
was his real name. He had, indeed, reasons
for thinking it wasn’t, but he had never been
able to discover anything; and when the
child was left to them, his wife had insisted
on calling her Moore. She had gone by that
name ever since.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this information was not given until
payment had been demanded and made, and
after that there had been a final settlement,
by which all the small belongings of the girl
were to be delivered up to Wyndham; over
this part of the transaction Moore had proved
himself specially shrewd. As the game was
up, he was determined to see himself really
well out of it; and in the end he made so
excellent a bargain that Wyndham found
himself a good deal out of pocket. The
price he paid was certainly a heavy one for
two boxes, that might contain anything or
nothing, and, for an astute lawyer like
Wyndham, bordered on the absurd. Beyond
doubt, if he went to law with the fellow,
Ella would have got her own, but then there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>would be the publicity, and—— Any way,
he paid it—not so much for the boxes, however,
as for the certainty that Moore would
go abroad and leave Ella free. It was for
that he bought and paid. But in spite of
his better sense, that told him if there were
anything in the boxes worth having Moore
or his wife would have traded on it long ago,
still he looked forward to the examining of
them with a strange anxiety.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they came, they brought only disappointment
with them—one was a hideous
trunk, absolutely empty; the other a small
dressing-case that had been costly when first
made, the clasps and fastenings being of
silver. The bottles inside had no doubt
been made of silver, but they were all gone.
It was a melancholy relic, and Wyndham,
looking at it, told himself that probably
Ella’s mother had picked it up for the sake
of its outside beauty (the wood was Coromandel,
and very pretty) at some cheap sale.
Inside it was as empty of information as the
trunk itself, a reel or two of thread, a pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>of old black silk gloves, and a little bit of
fancy work half done, being the only things
to be seen. No letters or clue of any sort.
It looked like the dressing-case of a young
girl. On the lid were engraved the letters
E. B. He was right, then—of course Ella’s
mother had bought it. What could E. B.
have to do with Mrs. Haynes? Unless her
maiden name. But it seemed a common
story, scarce worth looking into any further.
All that was to be seen to now was Moore’s
departure. And this he saw to effectually,
getting up on a pouring morning to see
Moore off, and giving him half of the
cheque agreed on, as he left the outward-bound
ship that took Moore with it. The
big trunk he got rid of through the means
of Denis, who burnt it, and the dressing-case
he took down to Ella, who regarded
it with reverence, and made a little special
place for it on one of the small tables in the
drawing-room of the Cottage. It was all
that remained to her, poor child—all that she
knew—of the woman who was her mother.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Were my whole life to come one heap of troubles,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pleasure of this moment would suffice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sweeten all my griefs with its remembrance.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For the twentieth time within the last hour
Susan has rushed tumultuously to the window,
under the mistaken impression that she has
heard the sound of wheels, and for the
twentieth time has walked back dejectedly
to her seat to the slow accompaniment of
her aunt’s voice: ‘Impatience, Susan, never
took a second off any hour.’ It sounds like
a heading from a copy-book.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Susan, after each disappointment, feels
her spirits rise again, and, with glad delight
in her heart, trifles with the work she is pretending
to do. Betty and the boys are on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the top of the garden wall, and have promised
to send her instant tidings of the approach
of the carriage. Susan felt she could not
watch from there the home-coming of her
Bonnie. The workings of the human mind
are strange, and Susan, who had climbed
many a wall in her time, and still can climb
them with the best, shrank with a sort of
nervous terror from being up there—on the
top of that wall—when he came! She would
have to climb down, you see, to meet her
little sweetheart, whereas here it will be so
easy to run out and catch him to her heart,
and ask him if he has forgotten his Susan
during all these long, long days.</p>

<p class='c004'>But truly this sitting indoors is very trying.
It would be much better to go to the
gate and wait there. Even though those
others on the garden wall will have the first
glimpse of him, still—at the gate she would
have the first kiss. Her father had gone to
the station to meet him, but had forbidden
the others to go with him. Susan had been
somehow glad of this command. But to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>to the gate! She had thought of this often,
but had somehow recoiled from it through a
sense of nervousness; but now it grows too
much for her, and flinging down her work,
she runs out of the room and up to the
gate, and there stands trembling, listening,
waiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Waiting for what? She hardly knows.
Crosby’s letters of late have been very
vague. They have scarcely conveyed anything.
But that Bonnie is alive is certain,
and that is all that Susan dwells on now.
God grant he be not worse than when he
left her—that he is better there seems no
real reason for believing. But still he is
coming back to her—her little boy!</p>

<p class='c004'>And in this fair spring weather too, so
closely verging on the warmer summer.
That will be good for him. If Mr. Crosby
had not taken him away when he did, surely
those late winter frosts and colds would have
chilled to death the little life left in his
precious body.... A perfect passion of
gratitude towards Crosby shakes her soul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>and brings the tears to her eyes. She will
never forget that, never. And though, of
course, he has failed in a sense, and her little
Bonnie will come back to her as he went—on
crutches, that had always hurt so cruelly poor
Susan’s heart—still, he has done all he could,
and he is to be reverenced and loved for ever
because of it. Who else, indeed, would have
thought of the delicate child, or——</p>

<p class='c004'>Oh! what is that?</p>

<p class='c004'>She strains forward. Now—now really
the sound of wheels is here. It is echoing
through the village street, and now....
Now a shout has gone up from the denizens
on the top of the garden wall, and now a
carriage has turned the corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>It has stopped. Mr. Crosby springs out
of it; he looks at Susan, but Susan, after
one swift glance, does not look at him; her
eyes have gone farther, to a small, slim,
beautiful boy who gets out of the carriage
by himself, and slowly, but without a crutch,
goes to Susan, and precipitates himself upon
her with a little loving cry.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>‘Susan! Susan!’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Bonnie! Oh, Bonnie!’ Her arms
are round him. They seem to hold him as
though she could never let him go again.
‘Oh, Bonnie! you can walk by yourself!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly she bursts into a storm of tears,
and the child clinging to her cries too. ‘You
can walk—you can walk alone!’ She repeats
this between her sobs, her face buried in the
boy’s pretty locks. It seems, indeed, as if
she has nothing else to say—as if everything
else is forgotten by her. The injury she had
done him has been wiped out. He can walk
without the aid of those terrible sticks.</p>

<p class='c004'>The child, thin still, and now very pale
through his emotion, yet wonderfully healthy
in comparison with what he had been, pats
her with his little hands; and presently he
laughs—a laugh so free from pain, and so
unlike the old laugh that was more sad than
many others’ tears, that Susan looks up.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is true, then,’ says she; ‘but walk for
me again, Bonnie! Walk!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Bonnie’s laugh rings clear—how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>sweet the music of it is!—and stepping back
from her, he goes to his father, who had
followed him out of the carriage, and from
him to Crosby, and from him back again to
Susan, slowly, carefully, yet with a certain
vigour that speaks of perfect health in the
near future.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan, who has looked as if on the point
of fainting during this little trial, catches
him in her slender arms. She is trembling
visibly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby goes to her quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should have given you a hint,’ says he
remorsefully. ‘I thought of only giving you
a glad surprise; but it has been too much
for you. I should have said a word or two.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is nothing, nothing you have left
undone,’ says Susan, looking at him over
Bonnie’s head, and speaking with a gratitude
that is almost fierce. ‘Nothing!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The others have all got down off their
wall by this time, and are kissing and
hugging Bonnie. After all, if they had had
the first view of the carriage, still Susan has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>certainly had the best of the whole affair.
Mr. Barry, with his handsome, gaunt face,
radiant now, is endeavouring to hold them
back.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will come in?’ says Susan to Crosby.
‘Auntie is waiting for you, to thank you—as
if’—her eyes slowly filling again—‘anyone
could thank you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you can!’ says Crosby, laughing.
‘I was never so thanked in all my life.
Why, your eyes, Susan! They hold great
worlds of gratitude. You’ll have to stop
being thankful to me, or I shall run away
once more. And’—he looks at her with a
half-laugh on his lips, but question in his
eyes—‘you would not like to drive me into
exile so soon again, would you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no!’ says Susan. ‘You have been a
very long time away as it is.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have missed me, I hope—by that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We have all missed you,’ says Susan
softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s a very general remark. Have <em>you</em>
missed me?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>‘Every hour of the day,’ says Susan
fervently—too fervently, too openly. Crosby
laughs again, but there is a tincture of disappointment
in his mirth this time.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Faithful little friend!’ returns he gaily.
‘No, Susan, I don’t think I’ll go in now;
but tell Miss Barry from me that I shall
come down to-morrow to see her and my
little charge. By-the-by, I have kept my
promise to you about loving him. It was
easy work; I don’t wonder now at your
love for him. I assure you I feel downright
lonely at the thought of leaving him behind
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He presses her hand lightly, and goes
towards Bonnie.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, good-bye, old man,’ says he, catching
the child and drawing him towards
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no. Oh, you won’t go!’ says Bonnie
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For the present I must. And mind you
go to bed early and sleep well, or there will
be a regular row on when next we meet.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>‘You will come this evening?’ says the
child, hardly listening to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No;’ he shakes his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To-morrow, then?’ entreats the child,
clinging to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To-morrow, yes.’ He whispers something
in his ear, and the boy, flinging his arm round
his neck, kisses him warmly. Crosby smiles
at Susan. ‘See what chums we are,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c010'>To-morrow brings him, faithful to his word.
It brings, too, a great many gifts with him.
Is there one child of the house forgotten?
Not one. And even Miss Barry is remembered.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, how good, how kind of you!’ says Susan.
‘Fancy remembering every one of us!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t believe I was ever called good
before,’ says Crosby. ‘It makes me feel like
the bachelor uncle’—as he says this he thinks
again of the kiss that Susan had once given
him—‘and old, quite hopelessly old!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense!’ says Susan. ‘You?’—looking
at him—‘you are not old.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>‘Go to, flatterer! You really shouldn’t,
Susan! Flattery is bad for people generally,
and for me in particular. I’m very open to it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t flatter,’ says Susan. She laughs
and runs away to answer a call from her
aunt, who is evidently struggling with an
idea, in one of the rooms within.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who’s that on the tennis-ground?’ asks
Crosby of Betty as they are standing on the
hall-door steps.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, don’t you know? That’s James.
He came back a week ago. Of course, now
I think of it’—airily—‘you couldn’t know,
as we were unable to write to you for the
past week. But it’s James. You remember
hearing about him?’ Crosby does. ‘Well,
he’s home on leave now. But,’ says Betty,
giving way to suppressed mirth, ‘I think his
wits have gone astray, and he believes his
home is here. Anyway, we can always find
him somewhere, round any corner, from ten
to eight. And’—she grows convulsed with
silent mirth again—‘he’s just as spooney on
Susan as ever!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>‘Yes?’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s perfectly ridiculous. He is here
morning, noon and night. And when she
lets him, he sits in her pocket by the hour.
Of course it bores her, but Susan is so absurdly
good-natured that she puts up with
everything. Come down and have a game
of tennis. Do!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Betty, who is <i><span lang="fr">bon camarade</span></i> with Crosby,
slips her hand into his arm and leads him
tennis-wards.</p>

<p class='c004'>So this is James. Crosby gives direct
attention to the young man on the tennis-ground
below him. A young man got up in
irreproachable flannels, and with a sufficiently
well-bred air about him. Crosby gives him
all his good points without stint. He is
well got up, and well groomed, and decently
shaved—and confoundedly ugly. He laughs
as he tells himself this. There is solace in
the thought. In fact, James McIlveagh
with his big nose and little eyes, and the
rather heavy jaw, and the general look of
doggedness about him, could hardly be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>considered a beauty except by a deluded
mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is playing a set with Carew against
Dom and Jacky, who is by no means to be
despised as a server. It occurs to Crosby,
watching him, that he is playing rather
wildly, and giving more attention to the
hall-door in the distance than to his adversary.
Game and set are called for Dom and
Jacky. It is with an open sense of joy upon
his ugly face that Mr. McIlveagh flings down
his racket and balls; and indeed presently,
when he goes straight towards——</p>

<p class='c004'>Towards whom?</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby, curious, follows the young man’s
going, and then sees Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan, with Bonnie! A Bonnie who now
trots happily beside her, and is evidently
quite her slave—a pretty undoing of the old
days, when she was always his. Tommy,
full of toys brought by Crosby—a white
rabbit, a performing elephant, an awful bear,
and various other delightful things tucked
under his fat arms—is following them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>And now McIlveagh has reached her. He
is speaking to her. Crosby, with a grim
sense of amusement at his own frame of
mind, wonders what on earth that idiot can
be saying.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently Susan, smiling sweetly, and
shaking her head as if giving a very soft
refusal to some proposal on the part of
James, comes this way. Tommy has caught
hold of Bonnie’s hand—the new Bonnie, who
can now run about with him—and is dragging
him towards the little wood, and Susan is
protesting. But now Bonnie is protesting
too. ‘I can go, Susan. I have walked a
great deal farther than that. I have really.’
Crosby, watching still, as if infatuated, can
see that Susan is studying Bonnie silently,
as if in great amazement.</p>

<p class='c004'>This little, well Bonnie seems almost impossible
to her. Bonnie going for a run—alone
into the wood!</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby comes up to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hardly realize it,’ she says gently, her eyes
still upon the retreating form of the child.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>‘A great many things are hard to realize,’
says he. ‘For my part, I find it very hard
to see myself supplanted.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Supplanted?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Decidedly. And by the redoubtable James.
By the way, Susan, I think you gave me a
distinctly wrong impression of that hero in
the beginning of our acquaintance. He
doesn’t look half so wild as you represented
him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘As for that’—indifferently—‘I suppose
they have drilled him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s quite presentable,’ glancing at the
young soldier in question, who, a few yards
off, is looking as ugly as any impressionist
could desire, and sulky into the bargain.
He can see that Susan is sitting with a
stranger, and evidently quite content—and—who
the deuce is that fellow, anyway?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What did you expect him to be?’ asks
Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Unpresentable, of course. I’ve been
immensely taken in. And by you, Susan!
You quite led me to expect something interesting—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>rare specimen—and here he is,
as like one of the rest of us as two peas.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did you expect him to have two heads?’
asks Susan, with a rather ungrateful levity,
considering James is an old friend of hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hardly hoped for so much,’ says Crosby.
‘I’m not greedy. As a rule I am thankful
for small mercies—perhaps’—with a thoughtful
glance at her—‘because big ones don’t
come my way. And I don’t think you need
be so very angry with me, Susan, because I
think the excellent James less ugly than’—with
a reproachful air—‘I had been led to
believe.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think him hideous,’ says Susan promptly,
and with no attempt at softening of any sort.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Alas! Poor James! But do you
really?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very really,’ says Susan, laughing. ‘Just
look at his profile.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s a good honest one,’ says Crosby. ‘If
a trifle——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I suppose it’s the trifle,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have seen worse.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>‘Oh! you can think him an Apollo if you
like,’ says Susan, with a little shrug. Shrugs
from Susan are so unexpected that Crosby regards
her with interest. The unexpected is
often very delightful, and certainly Susan, at
this moment, with her little new petulant
mood upon her, is as sweet as sunshine. It
seems all at once to Crosby that he is seeing
her now again for the first time, with a fresh
idea of her. What a little slender maiden—and
how beautiful, even in her thin ‘uneducated’
frock, that has so often seen the
tub, and is of a fashion of five years ago!
And yet, in a way, that old frock is kind to
her—who would not be kind to her? It
stands to her, in spite of its age. It throws
out all the beauties of her delicately-built,
but healthy young figure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan here, in this primitive gown, is Susan!
Susan got up in silks and laces and satins,
and all the fripperies of fashion, what would
she be like?</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a question quickly answered. Why,
she would be Susan too! Nothing could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>change that gentle, tender heart. He feels
quite sure of that. It would only be Susan
glorified! A Susan that would probably
reduce to envy half the so-called society
beauties of the season.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he breaks through his thoughts, and
comes back to the moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t like your tone,’ says he reproachfully;
‘it savours of unkindness. And considering
how long it is since last we met——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Susan interrupts him, remorse tearing
at her soul:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know. Seven months.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You must have found it long,’ says
Crosby. ‘I make it only twenty-two
hours, and’—consulting his watch—‘sixteen
minutes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh! if you are alluding to yesterday,’
says Susan, with dignity that has a sort of
disgust in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought you were alluding to your being
away in Germany. And as to finding it long’—resentfully—‘I
think you must have found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>it very much longer, if you can count to a
minute like that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Was there ever such a child? Crosby
roars with laughter, though something in
his laughter amounts to passionate tenderness.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Forgive me, Susan!’ He leans forward,
and takes her hand. As he feels it within
his—close clasped, and not withdrawn—and
with Susan’s earnest eyes looking into his,
words spring to his lips: ‘Susan, once you
took me under your protection. Do you
remember that old garden, and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Whatever he was going to say is here
rudely broken in upon by the advance of
James, who, though distinctly ugly, looks no
longer dull. He seems now dreadfully wide-awake.
Susan draws her hand quickly away,
and Crosby, who believes she has done this
lest James should see the too friendly
attitude, is still further mortified by her
manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think I told you you were not to speak
of that—that hateful day again,’ says she;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and turning from him as if eternally offended,
seats herself on a rug quite far away from
him, and in such a position that James can
find a resting-place at her feet—a fact he is
very swift to see.</p>

<p class='c004'>The others have all come up now, and
Dom, who is terribly conversational, opens
the ball.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What are you now, James?’ asks he.
‘General?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not quite,’ responds James gruffly, who
naturally objects to being chaffed in the
presence of the beloved one.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Colonel? Eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t be stupid, Dom,’ says Susan suddenly.
‘He is a lieutenant, but soon he’ll be
a captain—won’t you, James? Come up
here and take part of my rug.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no! no!’ says James, in a nervous,
flurried tone that is filled with absolute
adoration; ‘I like being here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear Susan, why interfere with his
mad joy?’ says Dom in a whisper that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>meant to be perfectly audible, and is so, to
all around. ‘He’ll catch cold to a moral;
and he’s frightfully uncomfortable. But to
sit at your feet: what comfort could compare
with that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Several,’ says Susan calmly. ‘Come here,
James. I want to talk to you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, from this moment she devotes
herself to the devoted James. Crosby she
ignores completely, and when at last he rises
to go, she says ‘good-bye’ to him with a very
conventional air.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you really going—and so soon?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The others have moved a little away from
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is the good of my staying when you
won’t even look at me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am looking at you,’ says Susan, flushing
scarlet, but compelling her eyes to rest on his—for
a moment only, however. ‘But—you
know I don’t like you to allude to that
day.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was a very small allusion. It gave you’—slowly—‘your
chance, however.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>‘My chance?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To amuse yourself with the man of
war.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think that I——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think a good deal at times.’ He laughs
lightly, if a little anxiously. ‘I am thinking
even now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Naturally’—smiling. ‘Am I not always
thinking of you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But what—what?’ demands she imperiously,
tapping her slender foot upon the
ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That you do not believe the martial James
so hideous after all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then you are wrong—quite wrong’—vehemently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes? Well, then, I think now——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That you are a very dangerous little
coquette.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s colour fades. A frown wrinkles her
lovely brow.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not!’ says she coldly. ‘If all your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>thinking has only come to that—I—despise
your thoughts.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is the nearest approach to a quarrel he
has ever had with her; but, instead of depressing
him, it seems to exalt him, and he
goes on his way apparently rejoicing.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LV.</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There has fallen a splendid tear</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From the passion-flower at the gate.</div>
      <div class='line'>She is coming, my love, my dear;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She is coming, my life, my fate.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To-day the sun is out, and all the walks at
the Cottage are glittering in its rays. Sparks
like diamonds come from the small white
stones in the gravel, and the grassy edges
close to them—clean shaven by Denis, who is
down again on a penitential visit to his wife—are
sweet and fresh, and suggestive of a
desire to make to-day’s work a work again
for to-morrow, so quickly the spring blades
grow and prosper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham, as he walks from the station to
this pretty spot, takes great note of Nature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Lately the loveliness—the charm of it!—the
desire that grows in the heart for it, has come
to him, has sunk into his soul. As he goes
life seems everywhere, and with it such
calm!... And here in this old home, what
a place it is! A veritable treasury of old-world
delights—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘Dewy pastures, dewy trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Softer than sleep—all things in order stored,</div>
      <div class='line'>A haunt of ancient peace.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>As he walks from the gate to the Cottage,
a slim figure darting sideways brings him to
a standstill. After her bounds a huge dog.
Wyndham restrains the cry upon his lips that
would have called the dog to him, and, standing
still, watches the pretty pair.</p>

<p class='c004'>He has come down to-day with the intention,
avowed and open to his heart, of asking
this girl to marry him. That the deed will
mean ruin to him socially he knows, but he
has faced the idea. That she will probably
accept him seems clear, but that it will not
be for love seems even clearer. She has
always treated him as one who had given her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>a helping hand out of her Slough of Despond,
but no more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many days have led to his decision of
to-day, and many thoughts, and many sleepless
nights. But he has conquered all fears
save that supreme one that she does not love
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>This marriage, if he can persuade her to it,
will offend his uncle, Lord Shangarry. Not
a farthing will that old Irish aristocrat leave
him if he knows he has wedded himself to a
girl outside his own world—a mere waif and
stray, disreputable, as many would call her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Disreputable!</p>

<p class='c004'>It was when this thought of what his
friends’ view of his marriage would be first
came to him, and with it a mad longing to
seize the throats of those hideous scandalmongers,
that Wyndham knew that he loved
the girl he had saved and protected—and
most honourably loved.</p>

<p class='c004'>And to-day—well, he has come down to
ask her to marry him. Shangarry’s money
may go, and all things else that the old lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>can keep from him; the title will still be his—and
hers; and with his profession, and the
talent that they say is his, and the money
left him by his dead mother—oh, if she had
lived and seen Ella!—he may still be able to
keep up the old name, if not in its old splendour,
at all events with a sort of decency.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella is now running towards him, as he
stands in the shelter of the rhododendrons,
the dog running after her, jumping about her,
with soft velvety paws and a wagging tail.
Suddenly he springs upon her and threatens
the daintiness of her frock.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Down now! Down now! Down!’ cries
she, laughing. She catches the handsome
brute round the neck, and looks into his eyes.
“Does he love his own missis, then? Then
down! It is really down now, sir. Not
another jump. See’—glancing ruefully at
her pretty white serge dress—‘the stains you
have made here already.’</p>

<p class='c004'>How soft, how delicate is her voice, how
full of affection for the dog! Surely, ‘There’s
nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Wyndham comes forward very casually
from amongst the bushes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh—you!’ cries she, colouring delightfully,
but showing no embarrassment—he
would have liked a little embarrassment. He
tells himself that the want of it quite proves
his theory that she regards him merely as a
good friend—no more.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; I have run down for an hour or so.
You’—looking round him—‘have been quite
a good fairy to my flowers, I see.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, your flowers!’ says she gaily, yet
shyly too. Her air is of the happiest. She
has, indeed, been a different creature since
Wyndham had assured her a few months ago
of Moore’s actual arrival in Australia. ‘Why,
they are mine now, aren’t they? You have
given them to me with this.’ She threw out
her arms in a little appropriative way towards
the garden.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In a way—yes.’ He pauses. Passion is
rising within him. ‘Come in,’ says he
abruptly. ‘There is something I must say
to you.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>The pretty drawing-room is bright with
flowers, and there is a certain air of daintiness—a
charm—about the whole place that tells
of the refinement of its owner. It is not Miss
Manning who has given this delicate cosiness
to it—Miss Manning, good soul, who is now
in the kitchen, very proud in the fond belief
that she is helping Mrs. Denis to make marmalade.
No! In every cluster of early
roses, in every bunch of sweet-smelling
daffodils, in the pushing of the chairs here,
and the screens there, Wyndham can see the
touch of Ella’s hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the far-off window, on a little table,
stands the dressing-case that he had sent her
after his interview with Moore. It is open,
and some of the contents—what remains of
them—with their silver tops, are shining in
the rays of the sun. The girl’s glance catches
them, and all at once the merry touch upon
her lips dies away, and gloom settles on her
brow. The lost bottles, the battered and dismantled
case, seem to Wyndham but the
broken links of a broken life, and a thrill of
pity urges him to instant speech.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>‘Don’t look like that, Ella.’ And then,
with a burst of passion and grief: ‘My
darling, what does it matter?’ And then
again, almost without a stop, ‘Ella, will you
marry me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment she looks at him as if not
understanding. Then a most wonderful light
springs into her eyes. But when he would
go to her and take her in his arms, she puts
out hers, and almost imperiously forbids him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says she clearly, if a little wildly
perhaps.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But why—why? Oh, this is nonsense!
You know—you must have known for a long
time—that I love you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I did not know,’ says she faintly. ‘I—even
now it seems impossible. Don’t!’ as he
makes a movement towards her. ‘Don’t misunderstand
me. I know now’—her voice
breaking a little—‘that it might have been.
But what is impossible’—her young voice
growing rounder, fuller, and unutterably
wretched—‘is that I should marry you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think because——’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>But she sweeps his words aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is useless,’ says she, with a strength
strange in one so few miles advanced upon
life’s roadway, until one remembers how sad
and eventful those few miles she has trodden
have been—how full of miserable knowledge,
how full of the cruel lesson—how to bear!
‘I am nobody, less than nobody. And you—are
somebody. Do you think I would
consent to ruin your life—the life of the only
one who has—who has ever stood my friend?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘This gratitude is absurd!’ he breaks in
eagerly. ‘What have I done for you? Let
you the Cottage at a fair rental!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, no!’ There is irrepressible sadness
in her air. She struggles with herself, holding
her hands against her eyes for a little
while—pressing them hard, as if to keep
down her emotion. ‘I won’t—I can’t go into
it,’ says she brokenly. ‘But when I forget—Mr.
Wyndham’—she turns upon him
passionately—‘never ask me that question
again. Nothing on earth would induce me
to link my name with yours.’ She pauses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and a hot blush covers her face. ‘My name!’—she
repeats her words with determination,
though he can see how the determination
hurts her—‘I have no name.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is all the more reason why you
should take mine,’ breaks he in hotly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And so destroy it. I shall not, indeed,’
says the girl firmly. Her firmness is costing
her a good deal. It causes Wyndham absolute
physical suffering to see the pallor of her
face, the trembling of her slight form. But
that he can shake her decision seems improbable.
Something in her face takes him
back to that terrible hour in which he first
saw her, when with pale face and undaunted
spirit she accepted the chance of death. Her
voice, even in this hour of renunciation of all
that she holds dearest, rings clear. ‘Do you
think I would requite all your kindness to
me by being the cause of your disinheritance
by your uncle? Do you think Lord Shangarry
would ever forgive your marriage with
a woman of whom no one knows anything—not
even her parentage?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>‘I am willing to risk all that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But I’—slowly—‘am not.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ella, if you loved me——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah!’ A cry breaks from her, a cry that
betrays her secret, and convinces him of her
love for him. It is full of exquisite pain, and
seems to wound her. Is it not because she
loves him that—— ‘Well, then,’ says she
miserably, ‘say I do not. Think I do not.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I will not think it,’ cries he vehemently,
‘until you say it. Ella, my beloved, what
has this old man’s wealth to do with you or
me? What has the world to do with us?
Come now, look into it with me. Here are
you, and here am I, and what else is there
in all the wide world for us two, Ella?’ And
now he breaks into earnest, most manly
entreaties, and wooes her with all his soul,
and at last—as a true lover should—upon his
knees.</p>

<p class='c004'>But she resists him, pushing his clasping
hands away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I will not! I will not!’ repeats she steadfastly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>‘Oh, you are cold; you do not care,’ cries
he suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He springs to his feet, angry, yet filled
with an admiration for her that has, if not
increased his love, made it more open to him.
A strong man himself, and hard to move, he
can see the splendid strength of this poor
girl, who, because of her love for him, refuses
his love for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>His sudden movement has upset the small
table on which the dressing-case is standing,
and brings it heavily to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a crash, a breaking asunder of the
sides of the case, and here on the carpet
before their astonished gaze lies a small sheaf
of letters and a faded photograph. Where
had they come from? Had there been a
secret drawer? Wyndham, stooping, picks
them up. A name catches his eye. Why,
this thing, surely, is a certificate of marriage!</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>As he reads, hurriedly, breathlessly, going
from one letter to another and back again,
from the few pages of a small disconnected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>diary to the marriage certificate in his
other hand, his face grows slowly white as
death.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, what is it?’ cries Ella at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Give me time.’ His tone is full of ill-repressed
agitation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again he reads.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl drops on her knees beside him,
her face no less white than his. What does
it all mean? What secret do these old letters
hold? The photograph is lying still upon
the floor, and her eyes, riveting themselves
upon it, feel at once as though they were
looking at someone—someone remembered—loved!
She stares more eagerly. Surely it
reminds her, too, of&#160;... of—she leans closer
over it—of someone feared and hated!
Oh! how could that gentle face be feared—or
hated—and yet, was there not someone,
who——</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I know it!’ cries she suddenly,
violently. She springs to her feet as if
stung, and turns a ghastly face on Wyndham.
‘Look at it!’ cries she, gasping, pointing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to the photograph at her feet. ‘It is
like your aunt, Mrs. Prior.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Like your aunt!’ says Wyndham slowly,
emphatically. The hand with the letters in
it has dropped to his side, but he is holding
those old documents as if in a vice.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mine—Mrs. Prior—oh no! oh no!’ says
Ella, making a gesture of fear and horror.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yours and mine, Ella!’ There is
passionate delight and triumph in his whole
air. ‘A moment ago you said you had no
name; now—now,’ striking the papers in his
hand, ‘you have one! These are genuine, I
swear they are, and they prove you to be the
grand-daughter of Sir John Burke, and of—strangest
of all things—the Professor.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—how can I understand? What is it?’
asks she faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He explains it to her, and it is, indeed, all
that he has said. The breaking up of that
queer old dressing-case, that afterwards Mrs.
Prior had most unwillingly to admit belonged
to Ella’s mother—the lost Eleanor Burke—brought
all things to a conclusion. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>was the diary in it that proved the writer to
be Eleanor Burke beyond all doubt, and the
heiress of her dead father, Sir John; and
there was the marriage certificate that proved
poor Eleanor’s marriage to as big a scamp as
could be found in Europe, which is saying a
good deal; and there were many other letters
besides, to show that the scamp, who called
himself Haynes to evade the law (and his
father), was the son of Professor Hennessy.
That Ella had forgotten the other name her
poor mother bore, ‘Haynes,’ and had let her
identity be lost in the word ‘Moore,’ had, of
course, much to do with the unhappy mystery
that had so long surrounded her. After Sir
John’s death—that left Eleanor, his eldest
girl, his heir, or failing her, her children—much
search had been made for Eleanor under
the name of Haynes, but naturally without
avail. Anyway, the whole thing had gradually
sunk out of sight; Eleanor was accepted
as dead, and her fortune lapsing to Mrs.
Prior, she reigned in her stead.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>‘You see how it is,’ says Wyndham, who
from a rather prematurely old, self-contained
man has developed into an ordinary person,
full of enthusiasm. ‘You are now Miss Hennessy—a
hideous name, I allow. But you
were,’ with a flick of humour, ‘so very
anxious for a name of any sort, that perhaps
you will forgive the ugliness. And you are
heir to a good deal of money on both sides.
Mrs. Prior will have to hand out a considerable
amount of her capital, and as for me&#160;...
I feel nothing less than a defrauder. You
know your grandfather, the Professor, left
me the bulk of his fortune—not knowing you
were so much as in the world at the time he
made his will. Of course, that, too—— Are
you listening, Ella?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The fact that the girl is not listening to
him has evoked this remark. Whatever
‘gray grief’ had to do with her a few
minutes ago, before the breaking of her
mother’s dressing-case, it has nothing to do
with her now. All the splendour of youth
has come back to her face, and all the happiness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>yet still it is quite plain to him that
her mind is not set on the money that fate
has cast upon her path, or on the high
chances of gaining a place in society, but
on——</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says she slowly, simply, and with a
touch of trouble, as if bringing her mind
with difficulty back to something far away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You must give me your attention for a
moment,’ says he sharply. Ever since he
discovered that she was not only the possessor
of a very good name, in spite of its ugliness,
but also the heiress of a very considerable
sum of money, all passion has died out of his
tone. If he thought, however, by this to
deceive her with regard to his honest feeling
for her, he is entirely mistaken. ‘There are
things to which you will have to listen—to
which you ought to wish to listen. And if’—with
a frown—‘you will not think of your
good fortune, of what will you think?’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a long silence. And then there
is a little rush towards him, and two arms
are flung round his neck.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>‘I am thinking,’ cries she softly, clinging
to him, ‘that now I can marry you.’</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>Heavenly moments on this side of the sky
are few and far between. It is Ella, so
strangely unlike a woman, who breaks into
the delicious silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That night! I wish now——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Wish nothing, so far as that is concerned.
That night I saw you first gave you to
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That sounds like fright,’ interrupts he,
laughing. ‘But you are not easily frightened,
are you? That night—you see, I insist
upon going back to it’—catching her hands
and drawing her to him—‘no, you shall not
be ashamed of it. That night in which we
both met for the first time you were not
frightened. You walked towards death without
a qualm.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, I was too wretched then to be frightened
of anything!’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looks at him, a smile parts her lips,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and slowly, slowly she leans towards him
until her cheek is resting against his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should be frightened now,’ says she
softly, tenderly.</p>

<p class='c004'>His arms close round her. He clasps her
to his heart.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>There was a deal of trouble over it for a
while, but when that faded photograph and
the certificate and the diary were brought
into a larger light things smoothed down.
Shangarry saw at once how it must end, and
accepted the situation gracefully; but Mrs.
Prior was a little hard to manage until Ella
(who refused point-blank to meet her) declared
her determination not to take more
than half the money that had been left to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>her by Sir John Burke, her grandfather. It
was quite astonishing how Mrs. Prior softened
towards her after that. But Ella stood firm
and would not see her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later on she might consent to meet—at
Lord Shangarry’s, perhaps (he had fallen in
love with the pretty, gentle girl who had endured
so much), or at Lady Forster’s house
this season—Lady Forster had written a very
charming note—but not just now. Gentle
as Ella was, she could not forgive too readily.
Yes, Lady Forster’s would be the best place.
They would be in town after their honeymoon,
and there they could see Mrs. Prior
and break the ice, as it were.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to-day no ice has to be broken. Ella,
who has arranged with Wyndham to meet
him in the old Rectory garden, has gone over
quite early to be petted and made much of
by all there—Carew excepted. That unhappy
youth, his first grand passion having
been ruthlessly laid in the dust, and with yet
another new trouble that had arrived by the
post some days ago upon his shoulders, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>carried himself and his injured affections far,
far away, to a distant trout stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham is staying with Crosby, who is
most honestly glad of his friend’s successful
exit from a difficult situation. He has, indeed,
been highly sympathetic all through, astonishingly
so for so determined a bachelor, as he
seems to Wyndham, who six months ago had
seemed quite as determined a bachelor to
Crosby. Only to-day, at luncheon, he had
told Wyndham not to mind about leaving
him when the ‘Rectory’ called. He (Crosby)
might walk down there later on. But he
advised Wyndham to hurry up, to start as
early as he liked, not to wait for him, and so
forth. Wyndham took him at his word,
decided not to wait, and was therefore
naturally a little surprised to find Crosby
on the door-steps, not only ready to go with
him, but distinctly impatient. This seemed
such devotion to the cause, such honest
friendliness towards him and Ella, that
Wyndham felt quite grateful to him.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>‘How happy they look!’ says Miss Barry
to Susan, finding herself alone with her niece
for a moment. She is looking at Wyndham
and Ella, who indeed seem to have reached
their pinnacle of bliss. ‘And no wonder,’
with a sigh. ‘He is a most excellent match.
Not only money, but a title—in the distance.
I can’t help wishing, Susan,’ sighing again,
and more heavily this time, ‘that it had
been you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Me! I wouldn’t marry him for anything,’
says Susan indignantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s what girls always say,’ says Miss
Barry mournfully, ‘until they are asked.’
Perhaps she herself had said it many times.
‘But I assure you, Susan, money is a good
thing—and your poor father just now, with
the loss of this four hundred pounds that he
had laid aside for Carew——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I know!’ says Susan miserably. ‘It
is dreadful. Poor, poor father—and poor
Carew, too! I suppose he can’t go in for his
exam now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, I’m afraid not, unless some miraculous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>thing should occur. Susan!’—Miss Barry
looks wistfully at her niece—‘James, now,
he will be well off—and he could help us.
If you could——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Could what?’ Susan’s eyes are almost
menacing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Think of him—in that way. He is well
off, my dear, and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall not marry James,’ says Susan distinctly.
‘I wonder how you could suggest
it to me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly he is very ugly,’ says Miss
Barry, who has grown, poor soul, very meek
of late; the smashing of the bank that had
held the four hundred pounds, the savings of
years, that the Rector had laid by with the
hope of putting his eldest boy into the army,
has lowered her spirit. Poverty seems to
pursue them. And the sight of the Rector,
crushed and more gaunt than usual, has gone
to her old heart. If only Susan—any of
them—could be provided for. How happy
that girl Ella is! how rich the man is who
has chosen her! and yet is she to be so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>as compared with Susan? Miss Barry’s
soul swells within her at the injustice of it
all.</p>

<p class='c004'>If only Susan could be induced to think
of James McIlveagh. But no, Susan is not
like that. She looks up suddenly, and there
before her eyes are James and Susan strolling
leisurely, in quite a loverlike way, towards
the little shrubbery. Can the girl have
taken her hint to heart? A glow of hope
radiates her mind for a moment. But then
come other thoughts, and fear, and trouble,
and a keen, strange disappointment.</p>

<p class='c004'>No, no! Susan—Susan to be worldly!
Her pretty girl! God grant she has not
been the means of driving her to belie her
better—her own—self.</p>

<p class='c004'>Good gracious! If Susan comes back and
tells her she has engaged herself to James
because of her father’s trouble—because of
Carew’s trouble—what shall she do? Miss
Barry, who is hardly equal to emergencies
so great as this, looks with a certain wildness
round her. Who can help her? That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>foolish girl must be sent for; brought back
from that shrubbery where Miss Barry, in
her panic, feels now assured James is once
again, for the hundredth time, proposing to
her, and being (no doubt to his everlasting
astonishment) accepted. The last words can’t
have been said as yet: there may still be
time to drag Susan out of the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham and Ella and Miss Manning are
coming towards her. Ella is going home; it
is nearly seven o’clock, and Wyndham will
have barely time to see her to the Cottage
and catch his train to Dublin. Miss Barry
bids him a rather hurried good-bye, and then
looks round for Betty. Betty is always useful—when
she can be found! But unfortunately
Betty and Dom have gone off to eat
green gooseberries in the vegetable garden,
a fearsome occupation, of which they are
both disgracefully fond, and that seems to
affect their stomachs in no wise. Betty,
therefore, is not to be had, but Miss Barry’s
troubled eye wandering round sees Crosby,
who is sitting with Bonnie on his knee, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>with courage born of desperation she beckons
him to come to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby, I want Betty. Where is she?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think she went into the garden a
moment ago with Dom.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mind—would you be so good as
to tell her I want her, and at once?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly,’ says Crosby, laughing; ‘though
she and Dom, or both, bring down all the
anathemas in the world on my head.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He starts on his quest, a little glad, indeed,
to get away from the others. Early
in the afternoon he had had a little tiff with
Susan—just a small thing, a mere breeze,
and certainly of his own creating. He had
said something about James—why the deuce
can’t he leave James alone? But it seems
he can’t of late; and Susan had been a
little, just a little—what was it?—offended?
Well, put out in some way, at all events.
Perhaps after all she does care for James.
Like to like, you know—and youth to youth;
and there can be but a year or two between
him and Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>At this moment there is a quick movement
of the branches on his left; someone is pushing
the laurel bushes aside with an angry,
impatient touch, and now——</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan has stepped into view; a new
Susan—angry, pale, hurried. Her soft eyes
are dark and frowning, but as she sees Crosby
they lighten again, and grow suddenly thick
with tears. Then, as though in him lie
comfort and protection, she runs to him,
holding out her hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>He catches them, and saying nothing,
draws her down the bank and into a little
leafy recess that leads to a small wood
beyond. The touch of her hand is good to
him. She has forgiven, then, that late little
conflict. She can be angry with James, too,
it seems. Confound that fool! What has
he been saying to her?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’ says he.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He has held one of her hands all the time,
but now she releases it. She has recovered
herself marvellously, but there is still a good
deal of nervousness in the laugh that breaks
from her as she seats herself in the old rustic
seat in the corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well—what?’ She is evidently prepared
to carry it off boldly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You don’t mean to tell me there was no
reason for that look in your eyes just now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a very obstinate look in his own
eyes just now, at all events.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What look?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>‘Susan,’ says Crosby, with a solemn shake
of his head, ‘you might as well give it up
at once. You were never made for this sort
of thing. You wouldn’t take in a new-born
infant. Come, get it off your mind. Make
your confession. What has the immaculate
James been doing?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘James!’ She tries to look surprised, but
breaks down ignominiously. ‘Oh, nothing’—hurriedly—‘nothing....
Nothing at all,
really! Only—he’s so stupid!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s been stupid very often of late, hasn’t
he? Look here’—severely—‘you are suppressing
something; either you or he (and
you for choice, I should say, judging by the
obvious guilt upon your countenance) have
been doing something of which you are
thoroughly ashamed. Even such small signs
of grace are to be welcomed, but in the meantime
I think a fuller confession would make
for the good of your soul. Come, what have
you been doing?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was James a moment ago,’ says she
slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>‘Was it?’—quickly—‘I thought as much.
But what was he doing a moment ago?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense’—flushing hotly—‘you know
what I mean—that it was James you were
accusing a moment ago.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True! And it should have been you. I am
in fault this time, then. That makes a third.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, indeed, because I am not in fault
at all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then it was the immaculate one! What
of him? Has he been at his old game again:
chasing you round the garden to——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby!’ There is indignant protest
in her tone, but the rich colour that rises to
her cheek tells him that his guess has been
at least partly accurate.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not that,’ says he. ‘Foolish James!’
Even as he says these idle words he is
cursing James up hill and down dale for the
abominable impertinence of him. No little
shred of allowance for James’ honest love for
this pretty maiden enters into his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well—go on! That is only a negative
statement—if it is a statement at all.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>‘There is nothing to tell. And’—she
pauses—‘and, any way, I won’t tell it,’ says
she.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby suppresses a desire to laugh. Oh,
how sweet—how sweet his little darling is!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not even to me—your guide, philosopher,
and friend? Susan’—he is looking into her
eyes as if compelling an answer—‘he proposed
to you again, didn’t he?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes,’ says Susan, as if throwing a load
off her mind; ‘and when I told him again
that I couldn’t and wouldn’t—he—he was
horrid. And he wanted——’ She stops.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes’—Crosby’s voice is sharp now—‘but
you didn’t——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no! But I hate him!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So do I, with all my soul,’ says Crosby,
more to himself, however, than for her hearing.
He stands looking on the ground for a
bit, and then:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So you have refused the gunner. Poor
James! You don’t really care for him, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought all the world knew that,’ says
Susan. ‘Why’—with almost pathetic contempt—‘can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>he know it? It is unkind of
him, isn’t it, to make me so unkind? But I
can’t love him—I can’t!’ A little sigh escapes
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rose on the straggling bush above her
is not sweeter or more beautiful than Susan
is now, with her pretty bent head and her
flower-like face, and all the delicate beauty
of her soul shining through her earnest eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>A strange nervousness seizes on Crosby.
He takes a step towards her, however, and
takes both her hands in his strong clasp.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, am I too old?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan turns her startled eyes upon him,
grows crimson, and then deadly white. She
pulls her hands out of his and turns away,
but too late—too late to hide the rapture in
her eyes, that the heavy tears in vain are
trying to drown.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, my darling! my own sweet little
girl! Susan’—his arms are round her now—‘is
it true? So you do care for me! For
me—such an old fellow next to you—you’—clasping
her to him and laughing—‘are only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>a baby, you know. But my baby now, eh?
Oh, Susan, is it true?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan tightens her hand upon his arm, but
answer makes she none.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Afterwards you may be sorry; thirty-four
and nineteen—a great many milestones
between us, you see.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, it is you who will be sorry!’ says
Susan, lifting her head a minute from the
safe shelter of his breast to look at him. It
is a lovely look. Poor James! if he had
only seen it!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you going to lead me such a life
as that?’ says Crosby, laughing. ‘I don’t
believe it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You know what I mean.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t, indeed. I don’t even know if you
love me yet.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, as for that——’ Suddenly she laughs,
too, and with the sweetest tenderness slips
one arm round his neck and draws his head
down to hers. ‘And, besides, I’m very nearly
twenty,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Look here,’ says Crosby presently; ‘too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>much happiness is bad for any man. Now,
you sit over there’—putting her into a far
corner of the old garden-seat—‘and I’ll sit
here’—seating himself with the sternest
virtue at the other end. ‘Don’t come within
a mile of me again for a while, and let us be
sensible and talk business. When will you
marry me—next week?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Next week?’—with a laugh—‘is that
talking business?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The best business.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, nonsense!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where does the nonsense come in? I’ve
been waiting all my life for you, and what’s
the good of waiting any longer—even a day?
See here, now, Susan. In seven days you
could——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I could not, indeed!’ She breaks off
suddenly. ‘You are coming nearer.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So I am,’ says he, sighing, and moving
back to his corner. ‘Good Susan! Keep
reminding me, will you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I certainly shall,’ says Susan, who has
perhaps been only half understood up to this.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>‘Well, if not next week—next month?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no,’ says Susan. ‘In a year perhaps
I——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How dare you make such a proposition!
Come now, Susan, you have heard the old
adage beginning, “Life is short.”’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, but I don’t believe it. And besides—no;
don’t stir. And besides—you are
coming nearer.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is all your fault if I am. You are
behaving so disgracefully. The idea of your
mentioning a year. I shall appeal to your
father.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am certain he won’t hear of it at all.
He—oh, there, you are coming closer again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says Crosby sternly, ‘enough of
this. I’ll stand no more of it. You shan’t
keep me at arm’s length any longer.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I? What had I to do with it?’ says
Susan, arching her charming brows.</p>

<p class='c004'>After which it takes only a moment to
have the arm in question round her again,
and to have her drawn into it—a most willing
captive.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>‘Do you remember when you made me
promise I would never steal anything again?’
asks Crosby, after an eloquent pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I have broken that promise.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You haven’t, I hope.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have, though. I’—with disgraceful
triumph—‘have stolen your heart.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a bit of it,’ cries Susan, with a triumph
that puts his to shame; ‘I gave it to you.
Deny that if you dare.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He evidently doesn’t dare. He does something
else, however, that is quite as effective.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, it’s a month, any way, isn’t it?’ says
he. ‘In a month we’ll get married, and we’ll
go away—away, all by ourselves, Susan—just
you and I, to the heavenly places of the
earth. You shall see the world, and the
world shall see you—the loveliest thing that
is in it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mean that we shall go abroad?’ says
Susan. ‘To Rome, perhaps?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To Rome or any other spot your fancy
dictates, so long as you take me with you.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>He draws her to him as he says this, and—‘Susan,
will you answer me one word?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s clear, truthful eyes fasten upon his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is it?’ asks she softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Am I the one man in all the world you
would see the world with?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The clear truthful eyes do not falter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why do you ask me that?’ says she.
‘Surely you know it.’</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>‘Where is your father?’ asks he presently.
‘Let us go and tell him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tell father?’ Her tone has an ominous
trembling in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, of course,’ says Crosby, regarding
her with some surprise. It must be forgiven
him if he thinks Mr. Barry will be decidedly
glad to hear the news.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I couldn’t,’ says Susan, growing quite
pale. ‘He’ll be very angry with me. He
will keep on thinking of me as a child, you
know, and I can’t get him out of it. When
I put on long frocks last year, I thought
he’d see it then, but he didn’t; and even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>doing up of my hair wasn’t of the slightest
use.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We might give him a third lesson,’ says
Crosby. ‘Come on, and let us get it over.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You’—Susan draws back, and her tone
now is distinctly fearful—‘You couldn’t go
without me, could you? By yourself, I
mean.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I could, of course,’ says he. ‘But——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, then, do,’ cries Susan, giving him a
little push—there are unmistakable signs of
cowardice about her. And all at once to
Crosby comes the thought, how pure at
heart all these people are—how ‘far from
the madding crowd’ of self-seekers! She
has not realized that he is what most of his
town acquaintances call a ‘good match.’ She
is even afraid to announce her engagement to
her father, lest he should think her too young
to marry. It sounds incredible, but a glance
at Susan, and a vision of the sad man sitting
alone with his new sorrow and disappointment
in his little study beyond, dissolves all
suspicions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>‘Yes—do go,’ says Susan. ‘To tell you
the truth, father is in rather a disturbed
state of mind just now, and I’m afraid he
won’t receive you very well. He may be
grumpy. He is unhappy. He has lost a
great deal of money lately.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A great deal?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A very great deal. Four hundred
pounds!’ Susan looks tragic. ‘And it
had been set aside to put Carew into the
army, so of course he feels it. The bank
failed, you see.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Banks will do these rude things at times,’
says Crosby. ‘But what I fail to see is, why
you can’t come with me, and get your blessing
on the spot.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, I’ve told you’—reproachfully.
‘Father is in a bad temper, and he——’
She pauses. ‘Oh, I can’t go,’ says she.
‘But you can.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Alone! After the awful picture you have
just drawn of your father’s wrath! Have
you no regard for my life, Susan? Is this
your vaunted love for me?—to abandon me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>remorselessly to the foe. Is it safe, do you
think? Suppose I never come back?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tut!’ says Susan. ‘There—go on! But
be sure you say it isn’t my fault.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That makes an end of it,’ says Crosby.
‘Your fault. Whose fault is it, if it isn’t
yours? Susan, I refuse to stir a step without
you. I feel it is your distinct duty to
be there, if only to see fair play and be a
witness at the inquest afterwards. Besides,
I should like you to gather up my remains;
you might give a helping hand so far. Seriously,
darling’—drawing her to him—‘I
think it would be wise of you to come with
me. He would understand so much better
if—if only you will look at me as you are
looking now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I’ll come,’ says Susan, sighing dejectedly,
but with another look that makes
his heart sing aloud for joy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s a darling Susan! But now, before
we go, I must put you through a strict cross-examination.
To begin with—you are positive
you love me?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>‘Positive.’ Susan, laughing, lays her
hands against his shoulders, pressing him
back.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That doesn’t look like it!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s true, though!’—laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And it isn’t out of pity?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll certainly have to pity you soon. Are
you going out of your mind?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No wonder if I were.’ He swiftly undoes
that unkind touch upon his shoulders, and
takes her in his arms and kisses her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think that is cross-examination,’
says she reproachfully. No doubt later on
she will be capable of developing a little wit
of her own.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are right. To continue, then: how
much do you love me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Better’—Susan’s eyes, now sweeter than
ever, raise themselves to his for one shy
moment—‘than anyone.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is vague, Susan. Give it a voice.
Better than—Bonnie? Oh no!’—quickly—‘I
shouldn’t have asked that. Don’t answer
it, my sweetheart,’ pressing her head against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>his breast. ‘We’ll take another. You love
me better than you thought you would ever
love anyone—tell me that, any way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, much, much more,’ says she. She
clings to him for a moment, then steps back,
and a little air of meditation grows on her.
‘Do you know,’ says she in a low, rather
ashamed tone, ‘about this very thing I have
lately been very much surprised at myself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is irresistible. Crosby bursts out laughing—such
happy laughter!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What are you laughing at?’ asks Susan,
a little nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; because you are just the sweetest
angel, Susan. What sort of rings do you
like best?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan is silent for a moment, and now
through all the rose-white of her skin a
warm flush rises.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are going to give me a ring?’ says
she. ‘Do you know, I hadn’t thought of
that. A ring! I have never had a ring!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>He draws her head softly down upon his
breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your first will be a sacred one, then. It
will be our engagement-ring, my darling!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should like a blue ring,’ says Susan
shyly, after a little while.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Like your own eyes. Sapphire, then?
So be it. It will do for a first one. But
you must have a keeper for it, Susan, and
you must leave that to me.’ He is silent a
moment. Where are the best diamonds to
be got? ‘Now, come,’ says he; ‘I think
honestly we ought to tackle your father
together.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Barry is sitting at his shabby writing-table
in his very shabby study. His pale,
refined face seems paler than usual, and there
is a look of dejection in his sunken eyes that
goes to Crosby’s heart. He has entered the
room without a word of warning—a very
reluctant Susan at his back—and has therefore
caught that look on the Rector’s face
before he has had time to take it off.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Barry,’ begins he quickly. ‘I—we—Susan,
where are you?—we’—with emphasis
that devastates the soul of the culprit next
him—‘have come to tell you that—Susan,
this is mean,’ as Susan makes a base effort to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>hide behind him once again—‘that Susan
and I’—he laughs a little here, partly through
nervousness, and partly because of an agonized,
if unconscious, pinch from Susan on his arm—‘want
to get married.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barry lays down the pen he has been
holding since their unexpected entrance, and
stares at Crosby as though he were the proud
possessor of two heads, or else a decided madman.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last a flush dyes the pallor of his
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sir,’ says he, with dignity, ‘if this is a
jest——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a jest such as you think,’ breaks in
Crosby quickly; ‘though I hope our life
together’—with a quick glance back at
Susan, who still declines to show herself—‘will
have a good deal of laughter in it.
What I really want you to know’—gently—‘is
that I have asked Susan to marry me,
and she has said “Yes,” if’—with charming
courtesy—‘you will give your consent.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barry rises from his chair. If he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>be paler than he was a moment since, he is
certainly so now.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean to tell me that you want’—he
points at the only part of the abashed
Susan that he can see—‘that you want that
child for your wife?’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a slight pause. It is long enough
for Susan to cast an eloquent glance at
Crosby. ‘I told you so,’ is the gist of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is nineteen,’ says Crosby; ‘and she
says that she——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he comes to grief; it seems impossible
to so true a lover to say out aloud that
Susan has confessed her love for him. He
turns round.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I really think, Susan, it is your turn now,’
whispers he. ‘You might say something.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan gives him an indignant glance.
Hadn’t she told him how it would be? But
dignity sweeps her into the breach.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It—it is quite true, papa,’ says she, faltering,
trembling.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is true?’ asks her father.</p>

<p class='c004'>She is not trembling half so much outwardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>as he is trembling inwardly. This
thing, can it be true? And that baby—but
is she a baby? How many years is it since
the other Susan—his own Susan—died?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That—that I love him!’ says Susan
brokenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she says this she covers her face
with her hands as if distinctly ashamed of
herself, and Crosby, divining her thoughts,
lays his arms round her and presses both
hands and face out of sight against his
breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barry looks at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is only a little country girl,’ says he.
As if disliking the definition of her, Susan
releases herself and stands back from Crosby.
‘And you—have large possessions—and a
position that will enable you to choose a wife
anywhere. Susan—has nothing!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She has everything,’ says Crosby hotly.
‘When I look at her I know it is I who have
nothing. What money, what position, could
compare with the wealth of her beauty?...
And now this gift of her love!... I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>only too proud, I think myself only too blest,
to be allowed to lay at her feet all that I
have.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He turns to his pretty sweetheart and
holds out his hand to her frankly. And she
comes to him—a little pale, a little unnerved,
but with earnest love in her shining eyes.
And as he bends to her she gives him back
with honest warmth the kiss that in her
father’s presence he gives her.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems a seal upon the truth of their
declaration. Mr. Barry, going to her, lays
his hands upon her shoulders. He is pale
still, but the look of depression that almost
amounted to despair that marked his face
when Crosby first came in is now gone, and
in its place is hope—and some other feeling
hard to place—but pride, perhaps, is the
nearest to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘God bless you, Susan, always!’ says he
solemnly. In this moment, as he looks at
her, for the first time it comes to him that
she is the very image of her dead mother.
‘It is a great responsibility,’ says he. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>words are slow and difficult. ‘Try to be
worthy of it! Be a good woman, and love
your husband!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I will—I will, papa!’ says Susan,
throwing her arms round his neck. It seems
such an easy request. And all her fear of
him seems gone. She clings to him. And
the father presses her closely to him, but
nervously, as if afraid of breaking down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby can see how it is, and touches Susan
lightly on the arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Go into the garden,’ he whispers to her.
‘I will meet you there presently.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a last quick embrace between
father and daughter, and Susan, who is now
crying softly, leaves the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will let me have her,’ says Crosby,
turning to the Rector. ‘And I thank you
for the gift. I think’—earnestly—‘you
know enough of me to understand how I
shall prize it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barry comes back from the window.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is such a relief,’ says he quickly, and
with extraordinary honesty. ‘It will be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>weight off my mind. It is such a prospect as
I could never have dreamed of for her. They
tell me’—absently—‘that she is very pretty;
her mother, at that age——’ He does not
continue his sentence. A heavy sigh escapes
him. ‘I have had great trouble lately,’ says
he, after a minute or two, ‘and this, coming
unexpectedly, has unnerved me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There shall be no more trouble that I can
prevent,’ says Crosby gently, calmly, yet
with strength. ‘You must think of me from
to-day as your son.’ He pauses. ‘By-the-by,
I hear that there is some little difficulty
about Carew’s continuing his profession. That
would be a pity, considering how far he has
gone. We must not allow that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no “we” in it,’ says Mr. Barry,
his thin white face now whiter. ‘I can do
nothing in the matter. As you have heard
so much, you, of course, know that the money
that I had laid by for Carew’s start in life
has been lost.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That failure of a bank? Yes; but——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are giving a great deal to my daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Crosby,’ says the Rector quickly; ‘I cannot
allow you to give to——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My brother, sir. Come, Mr. Barry, do
not make me feel I am kept at arm’s length
by Susan’s people. If a man can’t help his
own brother, who can he help? And, after
all, if you come to think of it, have you any
right to prevent my helping him—to check
his career like this? Besides’—laughing—‘you
may as well give in, as I am going to
see him through, whether you will or not.
If I didn’t, there would be bad times for me
with Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is something about him—something
in his happy, strong, kindly manner, that
precludes the idea of offence of any sort;
and Mr. Barry, after a struggle with his
conscience, gives in. That suggestion about
his having any right to deny the boy his
profession had touched him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, that’s settled,’ says Crosby comfortably.
And it gives an idea of the charm
of his character that, as he says it, no feeling
of chagrin, of smallness, enters into the soul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>of the man he has benefited. Mr. Barry,
indeed, smiles a happier smile than his worn
face has known for many a day.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘God bless you, Crosby!’ says he. And
then, pausing and colouring—the slow and
painful colour of age, ‘God bless you, George!
It is useless to speak. I cannot say what I
want to say. But this’—his tone, nervous
and awkward always, now almost stammers—‘this
I must say, that Susan ought to be a
happy woman.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, as to that,’ says Crosby, laughing
again, a little nervously himself now, as he
sees the other’s suppressed emotion, ‘I hope
so. I’ll see to it, you know. But there’s
one thing sure—that I’m going to be a happy
man.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He looks towards the window.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think she is waiting for me in the
garden,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, go to her.’ But as he walks to the
door the Rector follows him, struggling in
his silent way with some thought; and just
as Crosby is disappearing through it the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>struggle ends. Mr. Barry goes quickly after
him, and lays his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Crosby,’ says he, with sharp feeling,
‘it is good to give happiness to others. It
will stand to you all your life, and on your
death-bed, too. There, go to her. She is
in the garden, you say.’</p>

<p class='c004'>And there, indeed, she is, waiting for him.
He finds her in the old summer-house watching
shyly for him from between the soft
green branches. And soon she is not only
in the garden, but in his strong and loving
arms.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
